The example shows a straight beam with an I-Shape cross section being tessellated with a fine mesh. Figure 1 and Figure 2 display the rendering in a target application.

> NOTE&nbsp; The density of the mesh depends on the algorithm used by the application. In general it is recommended to not use an overly fine mesh to minimize data set sizes. The mesh density of the example is already very high.

The example shows a tessellation without adding the normals at each vertex to the data set.
