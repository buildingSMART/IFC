The examples demonstrate the use of various geometric shape representation types to express a simple geometric form of an element. The examples of advanced geometric shape deal with CSG having Boolean operations, advanced swept solid and advanced brep representations. in some cases, the same geometry is also provided as faceted brep or tessellation to compare the results.
