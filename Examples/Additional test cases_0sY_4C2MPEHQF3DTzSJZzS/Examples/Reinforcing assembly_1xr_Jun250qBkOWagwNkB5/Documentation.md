This example illustrates a beam with an assembly of reinforcing stirrups, the geometry of the stirrups is defined by mapped items linking to a mapped representation being a swept disk solid along a directrix. Figure 1 shows the resulting shape.

> NOTE&nbsp; The directrix is defined by _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_
