The mapped representation can be generated by a mapped item placing a mapped representation with a Cartesian transformation.

    The representation map, being a simple block, is inserted as a mapped item for the building element proxy within its local object coordinate system.
    It is transformed by a rotation by 45' in xy plane and by a non-uniform scaling with x-scale=0.5, y-scale=0.5 and z-scale=1.0. See Figure 1.
