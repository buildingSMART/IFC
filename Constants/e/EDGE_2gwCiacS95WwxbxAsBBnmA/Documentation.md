A shape modification along an edge of the element with the edge length as the predominant dimension of the feature, and feature profile dimensions which are typically much smaller than the edge length.  Can for example be a chamfer edge (differentiated from a chamfer by its ratio of dimensions and thus usually manufactured differently), rounded edge (a convex edge feature), or fillet edge (a concave edge feature).
