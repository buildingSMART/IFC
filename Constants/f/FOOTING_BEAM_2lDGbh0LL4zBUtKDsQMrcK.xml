	<Documentation>Footing elements that are in bending and are supported clear of the ground. They will normally span between piers, piles or pile caps. They are distinguished from beams in the building superstructure since they will normally require a lower grade of finish. They are distinguished from _STRIP_FOOTING_ since they are clear of the ground surface and hence require support to the lower face while the concrete is curing.</Documentation>
