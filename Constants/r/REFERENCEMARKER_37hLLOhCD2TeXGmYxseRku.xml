	<Documentation>The reference marker is a notation referent, typically located in the right of way of the road, rail or other transportation system. Usually reference markers are initially spaced at a uniform distance along the linear element being measured, though subsequent re-alignments can result in uneven spacing between the markers.
The physical item representing the IfcReferent.REFERENCEMARKER can be an IfcSign.MARKER (e.g., a bolt fixed on a post)</Documentation>
