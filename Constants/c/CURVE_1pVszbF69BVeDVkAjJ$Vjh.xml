	<Documentation>The resulting geometric item is of type curve and closed (with the only exception of the curve created by the _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_ which resolves into an open curve). The resulting geometry after applying a sweeping operation is a swept surface. This can be used to define shapes with thin sheets, such as ducts, where the thickness is not appropriate for geometric representation.</Documentation>
