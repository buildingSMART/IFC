	<Documentation>A displacement dependent type damper in which the resistance force generated is determined by the plastic strain amount utilizing the plastic deformation of the steel material. The axial yield type is a damper that yields energy by absorbing the steel material against deformation in the axial direction, that is, in the direction of expansion and contraction.</Documentation>
