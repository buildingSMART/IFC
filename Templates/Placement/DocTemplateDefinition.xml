			<Documentation>Provision of an object coordinate system for the &quot;element&quot; being absolute, i.e. establishing the _element_&amp;#39;s coordinate system directly within the implicit coordinate system of the project. The absolute placement coordinate system can be identical to the implicit project coordinate system, being (0.,0.,0.), are having a distance.

The absolute placement is realized by omitting the attribute _PlacementRelTo_at&amp;nbsp; _IfcLocalPlacement_.</Documentation>

			<Documentation>Provision of an object coordinate system for the _element_ being relative to the object placement of another element. The two applicable cases are

*  a project structure element (e.g. placement of wall relative to building story), or
*  a composite (or container element - e.g. placement of opening relative to wall, or building element part relative to wall).

The default requirement stipulated by this **concept template** is that the element may be placed relative to any element of the two categories given above. The general restrictions are:

*  the relative placement of _element_shall be supported for placing relative to _IfcSite_, _IfcBuilding_and _IfcBuildingStorey_.
*  the relative placement of element to the composite is supported depending on the concept &quot;decomposition&quot; that applies to the _element_.

A **model view definitio**n shall clearly define any further restrictions to the type of element to which this _element_can be placed relatively to.</Documentation>
