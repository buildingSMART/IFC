Objects may provide services to other objects, where the "assigned from" object acts upon or observes requirements of the "assigned to" object. There is a general cycle of assignments where [actors](../chapter-3.htm#actor){ .int-ref} (people) issue [controls](../chapter-3.htm#control){ .int-ref} (such as work orders or schedules), which may result in [groups](../chapter-3.htm#group){ .int-ref} (such as building systems) comprised of [products](../chapter-3.htm#product){ .int-ref} (such as building elements) operated upon by [processes](../chapter-3.htm#process){ .int-ref} (such as construction tasks) performed by [resources](../chapter-3.htm#resource){ .int-ref} (such as labor) which may in turn be fulfilled by actors (people). Requirements are established at the "to" side and are fulfilled at the "from" side, where costs, time, scope, or other metrics may be calculated in the "from-to" direction.
