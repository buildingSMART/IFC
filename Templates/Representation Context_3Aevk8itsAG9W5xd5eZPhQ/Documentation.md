Declaration of the geometric representation contexts used by the shape representations of contained elements. It is differentiated into

*  main geometric representation context (to differentiate 2D and 3D geometric representation contexts), and
*  specific sub geometric representation contexts for specific representation identifiers (&#39;Body&#39;, &#39;FootPrint&#39;, &#39;Axis&#39;, &#39;Box&#39;, etc).

The main geometric representation context also defines the precision factor and the true north direction of the underlying coordinate system of the geometric representation context.
