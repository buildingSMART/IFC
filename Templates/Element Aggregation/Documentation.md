Provision of an aggregation structure (or decomposition tree) of physical elments, where the _element_ is either the whole or one of the parts of an aggregated structure.

Note: The _Aggregation_concept is specific to the compositon and decomposition of physical elements. There is no order applied among the parts. Beside the decomposition tree structure, the sub concepts also determine the correct assignment of shape, geometry, material, property set and other information to either the whole or the parts.
