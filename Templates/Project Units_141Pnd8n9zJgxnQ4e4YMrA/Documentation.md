Provision of project units, those units are used for all geometric representations and they are the default units for properties (and quantities), if not overridden locally.

A **model view definitio**n shall clearly define which unit definitions have to be declared as the required minimum.

*  The minimum required unit definitions for all model view definitions that include a geometric representation (see concept template "_Geometry_") are 
    *  length unit,
    *  area unit,
    *  volume unit, and
    *  plane angle unit. 
*  The minimum required unit definitions for all model view definitions that include property sets (see concept template "Property Set") are: 
    *  all units required by the measure type or units defined by the included properties
