			<Documentation>Provision of an aggregation structure where the _element_ is part of another element representing the composite. The _element_ then provides the partial shape representation and it is positioned relative to the aggregate.

The default requirements stipulated by this **concept template** are:

*  the shape representation of the part has to be provided, the part shall have an own shape representation with the representation type &amp;#39;Body&amp;#39;
*  the part shall have an own material assignment, either directly assigned to the part, or to the part type.

A **model view definitio**n shall clearly define any further restriction to the applicability of assigning shape representation and material to either the composite, or the part, if it differs from the default.</Documentation>

		<DocTemplateDefinition Name="Element Decomposition" UniqueId="1RC1lU4BceGfS19GKxDcVB" Version="0.3" Status="draft" Owner="buildingSMART International" Type="IfcRelAggregates">
			<Documentation>Provision of an aggregation structure where the _element_, representing the composite, is decomposed into parts represented by other elements. The _element_ establishes the common object coordinate system to which the parts are placed relative. The _element_ shape representation is constructed out of the shape representations of its parts.

Note: On import the decomposition structure may not need to be preserved. The parts may either merged into the _&quot;element&quot;_, or may become independent parts. The shape representation and property information however has to be preserved.

The default requirements stipulated by this **concept template** are:

*  the shape representation of the composite is constructed from the sum of the shape representations of the parts.
*  the composite shall not have an own shape representation with the representation type &amp;#39;Body&amp;#39;, it may have a shape representation with representation type &amp;#39;Axis&amp;#39;, or &amp;#39;Box&amp;#39;.
*  the composite shall not have an own material assignment, material is assigned to the parts.

A **model view definitio**n shall clearly define any further restriction to the applicability of assigning shape representation and material to either the composite, or the part, if it differs from the default.</Documentation>
