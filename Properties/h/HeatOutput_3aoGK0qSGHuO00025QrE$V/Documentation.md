Total nominal heat output as listed by the Boiler manufacturer. For water boilers, it is a function of inlet versus outlet temperature. For steam boilers, it is a function of inlet temperature versus steam pressure.  Note: as two variables are used, DefiningValues and DefinedValues are null, and values are stored in IfcTable in the following order: InletTemperature(IfcThermodynamicTemperatureMeasure), OutletTemperature(IfcThermodynamicTemperatureMeasure), HeatOutput(IfcEnergyMeasure).  The IfcTable is related to IfcPropertyTableValue using IfcMetric and IfcPropertyConstraintRelationship.
