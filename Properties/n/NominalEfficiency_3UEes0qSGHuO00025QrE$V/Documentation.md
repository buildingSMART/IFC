The nominal efficiency of the boiler as defined by the manufacturer. For water boilers, a function of inlet versus outlet temperature. Note: as two variables are used, DefiningValues and DefinedValues are null, and values are stored in IfcTable in the following order: InletTemperature(IfcThermodynamicTemperatureMeasure), OutletTemperature(IfcThermodynamicTemperatureMeasure), NominalEfficiency(IfcNormalizedRatioMeasure).  The IfcTable is related to IfcPropertyTableValue using IfcMetric and IfcPropertyConstraintRelationship.
