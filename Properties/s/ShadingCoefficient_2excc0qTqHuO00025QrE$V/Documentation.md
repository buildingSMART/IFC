Reduction of the Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) value (equal to the g-value in Europe) of the glazing by applying a shading device. Commonly known as Fc (or previously z-Value). The total Radiation Transmittance g<total> = g * Fc. The reduction coefficient is given as a unitless value between 0 and 1; the lower the shading coefficient (SC) the less solar heat it transmits.</total>
