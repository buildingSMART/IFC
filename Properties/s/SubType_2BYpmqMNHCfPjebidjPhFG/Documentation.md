BEND_22_5DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 22.5 degrees. 
BEND_25DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 25 degrees. 
BEND_30DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 30 degrees. 
BEND_45DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 45 degrees. 
BEND_67DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 67 degrees. 
BEND_76DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 76 degrees. 
BEND_87_5DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 87.5 degrees. 
BEND_90DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 90 degrees. 
BEND_135DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 135 degrees. 
BEND_180DEGREE: Changes the direction of flow through 180 degrees. 
JUNCTION_CROSS_SQUARE: Branch fitting with two opposing branches that are swept in the direction of the main flow. 
JUNCTION_CROSS_SWEEP: Branch fitting with two swept opposing branches at right angles to the main flow. 
JUNCTION_TEE_SQUARE: Branch fitting in which the branch is at an angle of 90 degrees to the main pipe. 
JUNCTION_TEE_SWEEP: Branch fitting in which the branch is curved through 90 degrees to join a main pipe tangentially. 
JUNCTION_TEE_TWINBEND: Symmetrical pipe fitting in which two short radius bends curve through 90 degree to form a single pipe. 
+I1JUNCTION_TEE_TWINELBOW: Symmetrical pipe fitting in which two elbows curve through 90 degree to form a single pipe. 
JUNCTION_TEE_Y: Branch fitting in the shape of a letter Y. 
OBSTRUCTION_CAP: Device fixed onto the end of a pipe or pipe fitting to close it. 
OBSTRUCTION_PLUG: Device fixed into the end of a pipe or pipe fitting to close it. 
OTHER: Other fitting subtype.
NOTDEFINED: The fitting subtype is not defined.
