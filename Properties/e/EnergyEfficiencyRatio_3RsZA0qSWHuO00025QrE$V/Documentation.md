The Energy efficiency ratio (EER) is the ratio of net cooling capacity to the total input rate of electric power applied.  By definition, the units are BTU/hour per Watt.
The input electric power may be obtained from Pset_DistributionPortPHistoryElectrical.RealPower on the 'Power' port of the IfcChiller.
