Angle of the slab to the horizontal when used as a component for the roof (specified as 0 degrees or not asserted for cases where the slab is not used as a roof component).      

The shape information is provided in addition to the shape representation and the geometric parameters used within. In cases of inconsistency between the geometric parameters and the shape properties, provided in the attached property, the geometric parameters take precedence.  For geometry editing applications, like CAD: this value should be write-only.
