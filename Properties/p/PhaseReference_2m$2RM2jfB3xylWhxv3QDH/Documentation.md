The phase identification used for the device electrical input. This should be the same phase identifier that is used for the conductor segment providing the electrical service to the device. In general, it is recommended that IEC recommendations for phase identification are used (L1, L2 etc.). However, other phase identifiers may be used such as by color (Red, Blue, Yellow) or by number (1, 2, 3) etc.
