Sloping angle of the object, measured perpendicular to the slope  - relative to horizontal (0.0 degrees). 
Actual maximum slope for the passageway measured perpendicular to the direction of travel according to the current design. The shape information is provided in addition to the shape representation and the geometric parameters used within. In cases of inconsistency between the geometric parameters and the shape properties, provided in the attached property, the geometric parameters take precedence. 
Note: new property in IFC4.
