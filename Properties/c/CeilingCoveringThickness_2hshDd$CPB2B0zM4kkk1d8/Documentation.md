Thickness of the material layer(s) for the space ceiling.  

The thickness information is provided in absence of an IfcCovering (type=CEILING) object with own shape representation. In cases of inconsistency between the geometric parameters of an assigned IfcCovering and this attached property, the geometric parameters take precedence.
