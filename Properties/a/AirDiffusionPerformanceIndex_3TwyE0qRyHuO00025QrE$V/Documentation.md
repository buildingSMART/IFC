The Air Diffusion Performance Index (ADPI) is used for cooling mode conditions. If several measurements of air velocity and air temperature are made throughout the occupied zone of a space, the ADPI is the percentage of locations where measurements were taken that meet the specifications for effective draft temperature and air velocity.
