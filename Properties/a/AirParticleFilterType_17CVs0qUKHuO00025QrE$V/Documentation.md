A panel dry type extended surface filter is a dry-type air filter with random fiber mats or blankets in the forms of pockets, V-shaped or radial pleats, and include the following:

CoarseFilter: Filter with a efficiency lower than 30% for atmosphere dust-spot.
CoarseMetalScreen: Filter made of metal screen.
CoarseCellFoams: Filter made of cell foams.
CoarseSpunGlass: Filter made of spun glass.
MediumFilter: Filter with an efficiency between 30-98% for atmosphere dust-spot.
MediumElectretFilter: Filter with fine electret synthetic fibers.
MediumNaturalFiberFilter: Filter with natural fibers.
HEPAFilter: High efficiency particulate air filter.
ULPAFilter: Ultra low penetration air filter.
MembraneFilters: Filter made of membrane for certain pore diameters in flat sheet and pleated form.
A renewable media with a moving curtain viscous filter are random-fiber media coated with viscous substance in roll form or curtain where fresh media is fed across the face of the filter and the dirty media is rewound onto a roll at the bottom or to into a reservoir:
RollForm: Viscous filter used in roll form.
AdhesiveReservoir: Viscous filter used in moving curtain form.
A renewable moving curtain dry media filter is a random-fiber dry media of relatively high porosity used in moving-curtain(roll) filters.
An electrical filter uses electrostatic precipitation to remove and collect particulate contaminants.
