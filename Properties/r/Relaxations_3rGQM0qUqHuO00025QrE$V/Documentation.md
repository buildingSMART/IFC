Measures of decrease in stress over long time intervals resulting from plastic flow. Different relaxation values for different initial stress levels for a material may be given. It describes the time dependent relative relaxation value for a given initial stress level at constant strain.
Relating values are the "RelaxationValue". Related values are the "InitialStress"
