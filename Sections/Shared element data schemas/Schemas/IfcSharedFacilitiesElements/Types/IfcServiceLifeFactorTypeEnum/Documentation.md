**Enumeration:**

Note that the values given in the enumeration list are those indicated in the ISO standard relating to service life. In the standard, service life modification factors are identified as A to G inclusive. In the enumeration list, the A to G values are retained for conformance to the standard. However, each factor is also named according to its purpose. This semantic name is placed after an 'underscore' character immediately following the ISO factor.
