The element type _IfcDistributionControlElementType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of an element and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define an element specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A distribution control element type is used to define the common properties of a distribution control element that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. Distribution control element types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcDistributionControlElementType_ are represented by instances of _IfcDistributionControlElement_ or its subtypes.
