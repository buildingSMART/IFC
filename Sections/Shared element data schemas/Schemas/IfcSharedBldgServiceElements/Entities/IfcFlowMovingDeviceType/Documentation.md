The element type _IfcFlowMovingDeviceType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow moving device and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow moving device specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A flow moving type is used to define the common properties of a flow moving device that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow moving device is a device that is used to produce a pressure differential in a distribution system, such as a pump, fan, compressor, etc. Flow moving types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcFlowMovingDeviceType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowMoving_ or its subtypes.
