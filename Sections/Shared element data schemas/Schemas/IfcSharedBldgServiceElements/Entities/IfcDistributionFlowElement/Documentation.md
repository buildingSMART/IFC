> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Ports are now primarily defined using _IfcRelNests_ to enable definition of ports at type definitions (both forward and backward compatible), provide a logical order, and reduce the number of relationship objects needed. The relationship _IfcRelConnectsPortToElement_ is still supported, however is now specific to dynamically connected ports.
