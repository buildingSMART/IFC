This enumeration defines the flow direction at a connection point as either a Source, Sink, or both SourceAndSink:

* **SOURCE**: A source of flow (e.g., it flows out of the connection)
* **SINK**: A flow sink (e.g., it flows into the connection)
* **SOURCEANDSINK**: Both a source and sink (e.g., it flows both into and out of the connection simultaneously)
* **NOTDEFINED**: Undefined flow direction
