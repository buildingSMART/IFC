The element type (_IfcElementComponentType_) represents the supertype for element types which define lists of commonly shared property set definitions of various small parts and accessories and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a supporting element mainly within structural and building services domains (i.e. the specific type information common to all occurrences of that type).
