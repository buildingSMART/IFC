****Use Definitions****

Actor attributes such as the organization to which the order is sent, issuing organization, person responsible atc. are handled by assigning instances of _IfcActor_ through _IfcRelAssignsToProjectOrder_. The _IfcActorRole_ must be asserted with the value of the role set when used in this context.

A work plan (acting as a service) may be assigned to a project order (acting as a client) to describe how the project order should be fulfilled. This is handled by assigning instances of _IfcWorkPlan_ through _IfcRelAssignsToProjectOrder_.

The reverse of this situation may be true whereby the work plan (acting as a client) may have project orders (acting as a service). This is handled by assigning instances of _IfcProjectOrder_ to an _IfcWorkPlan_ through _IfcRelAssignsToControl_.

Approvals including signoff, authorization etc. are handled using the the _IfcRelAssociatesApproval_ relationship class.

A cost schedule may be assigned to a project order are handled through the _IfcRelAssignsToProjectOrder_ relationship.
