A project order is a directive to purchase products and/or perform work, such as for construction or facilities management.

Project orders are typically formal contracts between two organizations, where cost and time information may be rigid or flexible according to contained schedule types and constraints.

Object Approval

The [Object Approval](../../templates/object-approval.htm) concept applies to this entity.

Approvals may be associated to indicate the status of acceptance or rejection using the [IfcRelAssociatesApproval](../../ifccontrolextension/lexical/ifcrelassociatesapproval.htm) relationship where _RelatingApproval_ refers to an [IfcApproval](../../ifcapprovalresource/lexical/ifcapproval.htm) and _RelatedObjects_ contains the **IfcProjectOrder**. Approvals may be split into sub-approvals using [IfcApprovalRelationship](../../ifcapprovalresource/lexical/ifcapprovalrelationship.htm) to track approval status separately for each party where _RelatingApproval_ refers to the higher-level approval and _RelatedApprovals_ contains one or more lower-level approvals. The hierarchy of approvals implies sequencing such that a higher-level approval is not executed until all of its lower-level approvals have been accepted.

Control Assignment

The [Control Assignment](../../templates/control-assignment.htm) concept applies to this entity.

Figure 2 illustrates **IfcProjectOrder** assignment relationships as indicated:

* _IfcActor_ (_IfcRelAssignsToActor_): Organization issuing the order such as an owner or contractor.

The **IfcProjectOrder** may have assignments of its own using the _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship where _RelatingControl_ refers to the **IfcProjectOrder** and _RelatedObjects_ contains one or more objects of the following types:

* _IfcActor_: Organization(s) contracted to fulfill the order, typically a single contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.
