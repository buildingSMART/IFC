Deep foundation is a type of foundation that transfers loads deeper than shallow foundation below the soft soils not capable of bearing the above structure. Depending on the soil strength it might have to reach down to the rock layer.

Deep foundation is a new supertype incorporating the existing _IfcPile_ and the new _IfcCaissonFoundation_.
