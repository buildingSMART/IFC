A building system is a group by which building elements are grouped according to a common function within the facility.

The group _IfcBuildingSystem_ defines the occurrence of a specialized system for use within the context of a building and finishing fabric. Important functionalities for the description of a building system are derived from supertypes:

* From _IfcSystem_ it inherits the ability to couple the building system via _IfcRelServicesBuildings_ to one or more _IfcSpatialElement_ subtypes as necessary.
* From _IfcGroup_ it inherits the inverse attribute _IsGroupedBy_, pointing to the relationship class _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_. This allows to group building elements (instances of _IfcBuildingElement_ subtypes, _IfcFurnishingElement_ subtype, _IfcElementAssembly_ and _IfcTransportElement_).
* From _IfcObjectDefinition_ it inherits the inverse attribute _IsDecomposedBy_ pointing to the relationship class _IfcRelAggregates_. It provides the hierarchy between the separate (partial) building systems.
