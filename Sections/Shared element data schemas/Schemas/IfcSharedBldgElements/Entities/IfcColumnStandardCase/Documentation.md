The standard column, _IfcColumnStandardCase_, defines a column with certain constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcColumnStandardCase_ handles all cases of columns, that:

<ul>
<li>have a reference to the <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em>
defining the material profile association of the column with the
cardinal point of its insertion relative to the local
placement.</li>
<li>are based on a sweep of a planar profile, or set of profiles,
as defined by the <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em></li>
<li>have an 'Axis' shape representation with constraints provided
below in the geometry use definition</li>
<li>have a 'Body' shape representation with constraints provided
below in the geometry use definition</li>
<li>have a start profile, or set of profiles, that is swept along
the directrix and might be changed uniformly by a taper
definition</li>
<li>are consistent in using the correct cardinal point offset of
the profile as compared to the 'Axis' and 'Body' shape
representation</li>
<li>are extruded perpendicular to the profile definition
plane</li>
<li style="list-style-type:none">
<blockquote class="note"><small>NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementer
agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types,
e.g. by excluding tapering from an <em>IfcBeamStandardCase</em>
implementation.</small></blockquote>

**_Geometric Representations_**

The geometric representation of _IfcColumnStandardCase_ is defined using the following multiple shape representations for its definition:

* **Axis**: A three-dimensional open curve (subtype of _IfcBoundedCurve_) defining the axis for the standard column. The cardinal point is determined by the column axis.
* **Body**: A Swept Solid Representation or a CSG representation defining the 3D shape of the standard column.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is invalid to exchange a 'SurfaceModel', 'Brep', or 'MappedRepresentation' representation for the 'Body' shape representation of an _IfcColumnStandardCase_.

Material Profile Set Usage

The [Material Profile Set Usage](../../templates/material-profile-set-usage.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The _IfcColumnStandardCase_ defines in addition that the _IfcColumnType_ should have a unique _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, that is referenced by the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ assigned to all occurrences of this _IfcColumnType_. Composite profile columns can be represented by refering to several _IfcMaterialProfile_'s within the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ that is referenced from the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

Figure 1 illustrates assignment of _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ and _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ to the _IfcColumnStandardCase_ as the column occurrence and to the _IfcColumnType_. The same _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ shall be shared by many occurrences of _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. This relationship shall be consistent to the relationship between the _IfcColumnType_ and the _IfcColumnStandardCase_.

!["Material profile set and usage"](../../../../../../figures/ifccolumnstandardcase-01.png "Figure 1 &mdash; Column profile usage")

Figure 2 illustrates cardinal point alignment.

> NOTE  It has to be guaranteed that the use of _IfcCardinalPointEnum_ is consistent to the placement of the extrusion body provided by _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Position_

> NOTE  The cardinal points **7** (top left), and **6** (mid-depth right) are assigned according to the definition at _IfcCardinalPointReference_

!["Cardinal point usage"](../../../../../../figures/ifccolumnstandardcase_cardinalpoint.png "Figure 2 &mdash; Column cardinal points")

Figure 3 illustrates assignment of a composite profile by using _IfcCompositeProfile_ for geometric representation and several _IfcMaterialProfile_'s within the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_. The number of _IfcMaterialProfile_'s within the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is restricted to maximal 2 and requires the use of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered_, or _IfcRevolvedAreaSolidTapered_ for the correct 'Body' shape representation.

Body SweptSolid Geometry

The [Body SweptSolid Geometry](../../templates/body-sweptsolid-geometry.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The following additional constraints apply to the 'SweptSolid' representation:

* **Solid**: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ shall be supported
* **Profile**: all subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_)
* **Profile Position** : For all single profiles, the _IfcParameterizedProfileDef.Position_ shall be NIL, or having _Location_ = 0.,0. and _RefDirection_ = 1.,0.
* **Extrusion**: perpendicular to the profile direction. The _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection_ shall be [0.,0.,1.].
* **Orientation**: The y-axis of the profile, as determined by _IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position.P[2]_ shall point to the Y-Axis. It indicates the "role" of the column, a role=0&deg; means y-axis of profile = Y-axis of reference coordinate system.

Figure 6 illustrates a standard geometric representation with cardinal point applied as **5** (mid-depth centre).

The following interpretation of dimension parameter applies for rectangular columns:

* _IfcRectangleProfileDef.YDim_ interpreted as column width
* _IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim_ interpreted as column depth

The following interpretation of dimension parameter applies for circular columns:

* _IfcCircleProfileDef.Radius_ interpreted as column radius.
