The element type _IfcPlateType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of plates. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common material layer definitions
* common shape representations

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to share shape representations as representation maps for occurrences of _IfcPlateStandardCase_.

It is used to define a plate specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type). Plate types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

> NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

The occurrences of the _IfcPlateType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcPlateStandardCase_ if the _IfcPlateType_ has a single associated _IfcMaterialLayerSet_; otherwise they are represented by instances of _IfcPlate_.

Material Layer Set

The [Material Layer Set](../../templates/material-layer-set.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The material of the _IfcPlateType_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to assign an _IfcMaterial_ to an _IfcPlateType_, if there is at least one occurrences of _IfcPlateStandardCase_ for this type.

The shared material layer set definition is defined by assigning an _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ (see material use definition above). The _IfcMaterialLayer_ refers to one or several of _IfcMaterial_ that is the common for all plate occurrence, if used. It is only applicable if the _IfcPlateType_ has only occurrences of type _IfcPlateStandardCase_ (see definition of _IfcPlateStandardCase_ for further information).

> NOTE&nbsp; Since each individual instance of _IfcPlateStandardCase_ defines its own _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ including the offset from the reference plane, the same _IfcPlateType_ can be used independently of the reference plane alignment of its occurrences.
