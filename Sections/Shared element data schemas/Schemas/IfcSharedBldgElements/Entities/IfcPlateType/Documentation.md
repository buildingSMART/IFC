The element type _IfcPlateType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a thin planar element and an optional set of product representations (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

> <font size="-1">NOTE&nbsp; The product
representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the
supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which gets assigned by an
element occurrence instance through the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i>
being an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</font>

A&nbsp;plate type is used to define the common properties of a certain type of a plate that may be applied to many instances of that type to assign a specific style. Plate types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences. It is used to define a planar, or plate-like parts to be located by one or several instances of _IfcPlate_.&nbsp;

The occurrences of the _IfcPlateType_ are represented by instances of _IfcPlate_.

**Use definition for steel members**

When using the _IfcPlateType_ as underlying type for steel members in steel construction applications the following additional conventions apply:

**Material association:**  
The _IfcPlateType_ is associated with exactly one instance of _IfcMaterial_ by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_ relationship. This material association assigns a common material to all occurrences (_IfcPlate_) of the _IfcPlateType_. If an individual occurrence has an own material assignment (see _IfcPlate_), then that assignment overrides the material assignment given at the _IfcPlateType_.

**Geometric representation:**  
The plate type must have a full geometric representation, normally given by _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_. Possibly standardized profile names for the plate have no meaning. The _IfcPlateType_ has (at least) one representation map assigned through the _RepresentationMaps_ relation. The representation map has a full geometric representation given by:

* **Solid:** Only _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ shall be supported. 
* **Profile:** Only _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_shall be supported. The profile represents the contour of the plate. 
* **Extrusion:** The extrusion axis shall be perpendicular to the swept profile, i.e. pointing into the direction of the z-axis of the position of the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_. Since the profile instance represents the contour of the plate, the extrusion direction corresponds to the plate thickness. 

**Position number:**  
The position number is specified in the attribute _IfcTypeProduct.Tag_.

**Non geometric profile properties:**  
Non geometric profile properties (for instance mechanical properties) are specified through _IfcProfileProperties_ (and its specific subtypes that are related to the cross section). These properties are attached to _IfcPlateType_ by the relationship _IfcRelAssociatesProfileProperties_. If an individual occurrence has an own profile property assignment (see _IfcPlate_), then this assignment overrides the profile property assignment given in _IfcPlateType_.

**Quantity related properties:**  
Quantity related properties,which do not relate to the profile, are specified through _IfcElementQuantity_ (and its specific subtypes). These properties are attached to the _IfcPlateType_ by the relationship _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_. If an individual occurrence has an own element quantity assignment (see _IfcPlate_), then this assignment overrides the quantity assignment given in _IfcPlateType_. The following quantities are foreseen, but will be subjected to the local standard of measurement used:
