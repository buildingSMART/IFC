An _IfcBeam_ is a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, structural member that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1: structural member for carrying load(s) between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so.

> NOTE&nbsp; The representation of load-bearing beams in a structural analysis model is provided by subtypes of _IfcStructuralMember_ (with _IfcStructuralCurveMember_ being mostly applicable) as part of an _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.

> NOTE&nbsp; For any other longitudinal structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity _IfcMember_ should be used.

The camber of a beam may be defined by assigning a StructuralCurveMember with displacement coordinates. Multiple sets of camber ordinates may be provided that are qualified by the particular load case, where full dead load would typically be used for fabrication, and other scenarios used for other loading conditions such as during construction.

There are two entities for beam occurrences:

* _IfcBeamStandardCase_ used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. These beams are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ assigned. 
>> NOTE&nbsp; Model view definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, for example, by excluding tapering from an _IfcBeamStandardCase_ implementation.* _IfcBeam_ used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with non-uniformly changing profile sizes along the sweep, or beams having only 'AdvancedBrep', 'Brep', 'SurfaceModel', or 'Tessellation' geometry. 
>> NOTE&nbsp; Model view definitions and implementer agreements may impose the use of _IfcBeam_ in all cases by excluding _IfcBeamStandardCase_ from scope of the model view.
