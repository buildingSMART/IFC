The wall represents a vertical construction that may bound or subdivide spaces. Wall are usually vertical, or nearly vertical, planar elements, often designed to bear structural loads. A wall is however not required to be load bearing.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1: vertical construction usually in masonry or in concrete which bounds or subdivides a construction works and fulfils a load bearing or retaining function.

> NOTE&nbsp; There is a representation of walls for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of _IfcStructuralMember_ being part of the _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.

> NOTE&nbsp; An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable (is not predominantly vertical), shall be modeled as _IfcPlate_.

A wall may have openings, such as wall openings, openings used for windows or doors, or niches and recesses. They are defined by an _IfcOpeningElement_ attached to the wall using the inverse relationship _HasOpenings_ pointing to _IfcRelVoidsElement_.

> NOTE&nbsp; Walls with openings that have already been modeled within the enclosing geometry may use the relationship _IfcRelConnectsElements_ to associate the wall with embedded elements such as doors and windows.

There are three entities for wall occurrences:

* _IfcWallStandardCase_  used for all occurrences of walls, that have a non-changing thickness along the wall path and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by a material layer set. These walls are always represented geometrically by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ assigned.
* _IfcWallElementedCase_ used for occurrences of walls which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.
* _IfcWall_  used for all other occurrences of wall, particularly for walls with changing thickness along the wall path (e.g. polygonal walls), or walls with a non-rectangular cross sections (e.g. L-shaped retaining walls), and walls having an extrusion axis that is unequal to the global Z axis of the project (i.e. non-vertical walls), or walls having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.
