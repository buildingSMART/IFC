The _IfcWallElementedCase_ defines a wall with certain constraints for the provision of its components. The _IfcWallElementedCase_ handles all cases of walls, that are decomposed into parts:

* having components being assigned to the _IfcWallElementedCase_ using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship accessible by the inverse relationship _IsDecomposedBy_.
* applying the constraint that the parts within the decomposition shall be of type _IfcMember_, _IfcPlate_, _IfcBuildingElementPart_ or _IfcBuildingElementProxy_.

Property Set Use Definition:

The property sets relating to the _IfcWallElementedCase_ are defined at the supertype _IfcWall_.

> NOTE&nbsp; The parts within the decomposition relationship may define their own property sets.

{ .use-head}
Quantity Use Definition:

The quantities relating to the _IfcWallElementedCase_ are defined at the supertype _IfcWall_.

> NOTE&nbsp; The parts within the decomposition relationship may define their own individual quantities.

{ .use-head}
Voiding Use Definition:

As shown in Figure 1, openings within the composite wall are directly assigned to _IfcWallElementedCase_ using _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcOpeningElement_ and apply to all aggregated parts. If individual parts have cutting and other voiding features, then the decomposed parts have a separate voiding relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcVoidingFeature_.

**_Geometric Representation_**

The standard geometric representation of _IfcWallElementedCase_ is defined using the following multiple shape representations for its definition:

* **Axis**: A two-dimensional open curve being a subtype of _IfcBoundedCurve_ defining the axis for the elemented wall. It maybe used as a simplified representation directly at the elemented wall.
* **Surface**: A three-dimensional surface being a subtype of _IfcBoundedSurface_ defining the reference surface for the elemented wall. It maybe used as a simplified representation directly at the elemented wall.

Surface Geometry

The [Surface Geometry](../../templates/surface-geometry.htm) concept applies to this entity.

> NOTE&nbsp; The 'Surface' can be used to define a surfacic model of the building (e.g. for analytical purposes, or for reduced Level of Detail representation). It could suppress the geometric details of the parts in the decomposition.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is invalid to exchange a 'Body' shape representation of an _IfcWallElementedCase_. The body geometry is defined by the parts within the decomposition.
