This objectified relationship (_IfcRelAssignsToControl_) handles the assignment of a control (subtype of _IfcControl_) to other objects (subtypes of _IfcObject_, with the exception of controls).

> **For example**: The assignment of a cost (as subtype of _IfcControl_) to a building element (as subtype of _IfcObject_) is an application of this generic relationship.
