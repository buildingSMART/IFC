This objectified relationship (_IfcRelAssociatesDocument_) handles the assignment of a document information (items of the select _IfcDocumentSelect_) to objects (subtypes of _IfcObject_).

The relationship is used to assign a document reference or a more detailed document information to objects. A single document reference can be applied to multiple objects.

The inherited attribute _RelatedObjects_ define the objects to which the document association is applied. The attribute _RelatingDocument_ is the reference to a document reference, applied to the object(s).
