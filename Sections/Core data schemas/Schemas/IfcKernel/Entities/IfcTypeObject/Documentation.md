The object type defines the specific information about a type, being common to all occurrences of this type. It refers to the specific level of the well recognized _generic - specific - occurrance_ modeling paradigm. The _IfcTypeObject_ gets assigned to the individual object instances (the occurrences) via the _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationship.

> NOTE&nbsp; The terms 'Type' and 'Style' are often used interchangeably.

The object type is represented by a set of property set definitions. The attached property sets describe the available alpha-numeric information about the object type. and are used to define all common properties that apply to all object occurrences of that type.

> NOTE&nbsp; If a property having having the same name is used within the _IfcPropertySet_ assigned to an _IfcTypeObject_ (and subtypes) and to an occurrence of that type, then the occurrence property overrides the type property. See _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for an explanatory figure.

Object types may be exchanged without being already assigned to objects. An object type may have an indication of the library (or catalogue) from which its definition originates. This association is handled by the inherited _HasAssociations_ relationship pointing to _IfcRelAssociatesLibrary_.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x

{ .change-ifc2x3}
> IFC2x3 CHANGE&nbsp; The _IfcTypeObject_ is now subtyped from the new supertype _IfcObjectDefinition_, and the attribute _HasPropertySets_ has been changed from a LIST into a SET.

{ .change-ifc4}
> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The entity _IfcTypeObject_ shall not be instantiated from IFC4 onwards. It will be changed into an ABSTRACT supertype in future releases of IFC. The inverse attribute _Types_ has been renamed from _ObjectTypeOf_.
