_IfcPropertySetDefinition_ is a generalization of all individual property sets that can be assigned to an object or type object. The property set definition can be either:

* **Dynamically extendable property sets** - _IfcPropertySet_, a set of properties for which the IFC specification only provides a kind of "meta model", to be further declared by agreement. This means no entity definition of the properties exists within the IFC specification. The declaration is done by assigning a significant string value to the _Name_ attribute of the entity as defined in the entity _IfcPropertySet_ and at each subtype of _IfcProperty_, referenced by the property set. Dynamically defined property sets may have an underlying template provided by _IfcPropertySetTemplate_.
* **Statically defined property sets** - _IfcPreDefinedPropertySet_, a property set entity that exists within the IFC specification. The semantic meaning of each statically defined property set is declared by its entity type and the meaning of the properties is defined by the name and data type of the explicit attribute representing it.

Property set definitions define information that is shared among multiple instances of objects, either object occurrences or object types. _IfcPropertySetDefinition_'s (by their instantiable subtypes) can participate within the following relationships:

* **Assignment to object types** - an _DefinesType_ direct relationship to _IfcTypeObject_ that applies the property set, with all included properties, to the object type. Those properties apply to all object occurrences having the same object type.
* **Assignment to object occurrences** - an _DefinesOccurrence_ relationship to _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ that applies the property set, with all included properties, to the object occurrence.

> NOTE&nbsp; Properties assigned to object occurrences may override properties assigned to the object type. See _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for further information.
