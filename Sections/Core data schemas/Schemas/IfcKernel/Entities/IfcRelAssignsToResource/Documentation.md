This objectified relationship (_IfcRelAssignsToResource_) handles the assignment of objects (subtypes of _IfcObject_) to a resource (subtypes of _IfcResource_).

> **For example**: The assignment of a resource (e.g. a labor resource - as subtype of _IfcResource_) to a construction process on site (process as subtype of _IfcObject_) , is an application of this generic relationship.
