A definition relationship (_IfcRelDefines_) that uses a type definition or property set definition (seens as partial type information) to define the properties of the object instance. It is a specific - occurrence relationship with implied dependencies (as the occurrence properties depend on the specific properties).

The _IfcRelDefines_ relationship establishes the link between one type (specific) information and several objects (occurrences). Those occurrences then share the same type (or partial type) information.

		Thereby they share the same properties. This relationship is established by a
		subtype of the <i>IfcRelDefines</i> relationship assigning an
		<i>IfcProductType</i> (or subtype thereof) to the
		<i>IfcWindow</i>.</font>
