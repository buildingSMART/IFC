The _IfcPropertyDefinition_ defines the generalization of all characteristics (i.e. a grouping of individual properties), that may be assigned to objects. Currently, subtypes of _IfcPropertyDefinition_ include property set definitions, and property sets..

Property definitions define information that is shared among multiple instances of objects. The assignment of the shared information to objects is handled by the _IfcRelDefines_ relationship.
