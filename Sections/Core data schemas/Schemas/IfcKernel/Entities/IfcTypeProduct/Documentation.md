The product type (_IfcTypeProduct_) defines a list of property set definitions of a product and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a product specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

		  representation item 'IfcMappedItem'.</font>

A product type is used to define the common properties of a certain type or style of an object that may be applied to instances of those products to assign a specific style to them. Product types may be exchanges without being already assigned to products.
