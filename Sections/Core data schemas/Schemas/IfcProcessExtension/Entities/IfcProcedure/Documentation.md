_IfcProcedure_ is used to capture information about stepped processes such as calibration, start/stop procedures for equipment items, designated actions to take in the event of an emergency etc. A procedure is not a task, but may describe a set of tasks and their order of occurrence in response to or to cause an event.

As shown in Figure 11, _IfcProcedure_ does not restrict anything but describes specific steps of how something should happen. While a procedure does control/restrict in the sense of indicating "this is how the task should be performed" by nature of describing inner detail, this is not different than parts of a product indicating "this is how the parts should be assembled". Consequently, it doesn't restrict the outer item as a whole but provides inner detail of the item.
