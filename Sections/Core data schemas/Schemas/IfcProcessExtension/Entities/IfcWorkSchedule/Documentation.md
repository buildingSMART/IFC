Declaration Use Definition

_IfcWorkSchedule_ can reference a project (the single _IfcProject_ instance) via _IfcRelDeclares_.

Figure 1 shows the backbone structure of a work schedule that defines (1) a context through _IfcRelDeclares_ (not necessarily the project) and (2) controls tasks (typically the schedule summary task) and resources. Please note that a work calendar shall be assigned to the summary task and not the work schedule.
