The objectified relationship, _IfcRelCoversSpace_, relates a space object to one or many coverings, which faces (or is assigned to) the space.

> <small>NOTE Particularly floorings, ceilings and wall
        coverings, such as claddings or tiling are often
        considered as space coverings, rather then wall or slab
        coverings. In some life cycle phases, such as the
        operation phase, the relationship is always made to the
        space.</small>
> 


The IFC specification provides two relationships:

*  _IfcRelCoversBldgElements_ to assign coverings to elements, and 
*  _IfcRelCoversSpaces_ to assign coverings to spaces 

Which relationship should be applied has to be determined by the context of the project or application .

> <small>NOTE View definition may determine the necessity
        to use either of the two relationship elements</small>
