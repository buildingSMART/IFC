**Definition from ISO 6707-1:1989**: Major functional part of a building, examples are foundation, floor, roof, wall.

The building element comprises all elements that are primarily part of the construction of a building, i.e., its structural and space separating system.

> <small>EXAMPLEs of building elements are walls, beams, or
      doors, they are all physically existent and tangible
      things.</small>

The _IfcBuildingElement_ utilizes the following capabilities mainly through inverse attributes referencing objectified relationships:

****Quantity Use Definition****:

The quantities relating to the _IfcBuildingElement_ are defined by the _IfcElementQuantity_ and attached by the _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_. A detailed specification for individual quantities is introduced at the level of subtypes of _IfcBuildingElement_.

****Geometry Use Definitions****

The geometric representation of any _IfcBuildingElement_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ and _IfcLocalPlacement_ allowing multiple geometric representations.

**Local Placement**

The local placement for any _IfcBuildingElement_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations. Further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes.

**_Geometric Representations_**

Any _IfcBuildingElement_ can be represented by one or several geometric representations. A detailed specification is introduced at the level of subtypes. Only the general representation types 'BoundingBox', 'SurfaceModel', 'Brep', and 'MappedRepresentation' are defined here.

**Bounding Box Representation**

Any _IfcBuildingElement_ may be represented as a bounding box, which shows the maximum extend of the body within the coordinated system established by the _IfcLocalPlacement_. The bounding box representation is the simplest geometric representation available. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

*  _RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'Box' ~~Body~~ 
*  _RepresentationType_ : 'BoundingBox'

      <tbody>
        <tr valign="top">
          <td align="left" valign="top">

          <td align="left" valign="top">
            <p>
              <font size="-1">The bounding box representation is
              given by an <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>, which
              includes a single item, an

            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

**SurfaceModel Representation**

Any _IfcBuildingElement_ (so far no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented as a single or multiple surface models, based on either shell or face based models. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

*  _RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'Body' 
*  _RepresentationType_ : 'SurfaceModel' 

In some cases it may be useful to also expose a simple representation as a bounding box representation of the same complex shape.

            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

**Brep Representation**

Any _IfcBuildingElement_ (so far no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented as a single or multiple Boundary Representation elements (which are restricted to faceted Brep with or without voids). The Brep representation allows for the representation of complex element shape. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

*  _RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'Body' 
*  _RepresentationType_ : 'Brep' 

In some cases it may be useful to also expose a simple representation as a bounding box representation of the same complex shape.

          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

**MappedRepresentation**

Any _IfcBuildingElement_ (so far no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented using the MappedRepresentation. This shall be supported as it allows for reusing the geometry definition of a type at all occurrences of the same type. The following attribute values for the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ holding this geometric representation shall be used:

*  _RepresentationIdentifier_ : 'Body' 
*  _RepresentationType_ : 'MappedRepresentation' 

The same constraints, as given for the 'SurfaceModel' and the 'Brep' geometric representation, shall apply to the _MappedRepresentation_ of the _IfcRepresentationMap_.
