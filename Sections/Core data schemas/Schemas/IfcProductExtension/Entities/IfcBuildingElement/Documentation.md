This _IfcBuildingElement_ is a generalization of all elements that participate in a building system. Typical examples of __IfcBuildingElement__'s are (among others):

* building elements within a space separation systems 
* building elements within an enclosure system (such as a facade) 
* building elements within a fenestration system 
* building elements within a load bearing system 
* building elements within a foundation system 

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Building elements are walls, curtain wall, doors, columns, pile, and others.

The _IfcBuildingElement_ is an abstract entity that cannot be instantiated. For arbitrary building elements, that cannot be expressed by a subtype of _IfcBuildingElement_, use _IfcBuildingElementProxy_.
