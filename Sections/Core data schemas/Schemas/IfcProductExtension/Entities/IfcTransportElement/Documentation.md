A transport element is a generalization of all transport related objects that move people, animals or goods within a building or building complex. The _IfcTransportElement_ defines the occurrence of a transport element, that (if given), is expressed by the _IfcTransportElementType_.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Transportation elements include elevator (lift), escalator, moving walkway, etc.

> NOTE&nbsp; More detailed equipment that may be a part of a transportation device, like a lifting hook, is defined as _IfcDiscreteAccessory_. It maybe included as a part of the _IfcTransportElement_ by virtue of the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.

Depending on local classification systems transport elements and transportation systems in buildings are either considered as part of a building system, or as part of a building service system. Within IFC they are considered as part of a building system and may have to be mapped appropriately.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x.

{ .change-ifc2x}
> IFC2x CHANGE&nbsp; The attribute _PredefinedType_ (previously OperationType) is made optional.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The last attributes CapacityByWeight and CapacityByNumber are removed, use Pset_TransportElementCommon instead.

Object Typing

The [Object Typing](../../templates/object-typing.htm) concept applies to this entity.

_IfcTransportElement_ defines the occuurence of any transportation device, common information about transportation device types (or styles) is handled by _IfcTransportElementType_. The _IfcTransportElementType_ (if present) may establish the common&nbsp;type name, usage (or predefined) type, common material layer set, common set of properties and common shape representations (using _IfcRepresentationMap_). The _IfcTransportElementType_ is attached using the _IfcRelDefinedByType.RelatingType_ objectified relationship and is accessible by the inverse _<font color="#0000FF">IsTypedBy</font>_ attribute.

If no _IfcTransportElementType_ is attached&nbsp;(i.e. if only occurrence information is given) the _PredefinedType_ should be provided. If set to .USERDEFINED. a user defined value can be provided by the _ObjectType_ attribute.

Spatial Containment

The [Spatial Containment](../../templates/spatial-containment.htm) concept applies to this entity.

* The _IfcTransportElement_ is placed within the project spatial hierarchy using the objectified relationship _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_, refering to it by its inverse attribute _SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_. Subtypes of&nbsp;_IfcSpatialStructureElement_ are valid spatial containers, with _IfcBuilding_ being the default container.
