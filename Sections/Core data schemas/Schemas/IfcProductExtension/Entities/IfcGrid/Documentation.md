_IfcGrid_ ia a planar design grid defined in 3D space used as an aid in locating structural and design elements. The position of the grid (_ObjectPlacement_) is defined by a 3D coordinate system (and thereby the design grid can be used in plan, section or in any position relative to the world coordinate system). The position can be relative to the object placement of other products or grids. The XY plane of the 3D coordinate system is used to place the grid axes, which are 2D curves (for example, line, circle, arc, polyline).

The inherited attributes _Name_ and _Description_ can be used to define a descriptive name of the grid and to indicate the grid's purpose. A grid is defined by (normally) two, or (in case of a triangular grid) three lists of grid axes. The following figures shows some examples.

A grid may support a rectangular layout as shown in Figure 1, a radial layout as shown in Figure 2, or a triangular layout as shown in Figure 3.

> NOTE&nbsp; The _PredefinedType_ denotes the type of grid that is represented by _IfcGrid_. The instantiation of _IfcGridAxis_'s has to agree to the _PredefinedType_, if provided.

> NOTE&nbsp; The grid axes, defined within the design grid, are those elements to which project objects will be placed relatively using the _IfcGridPlacement_.
