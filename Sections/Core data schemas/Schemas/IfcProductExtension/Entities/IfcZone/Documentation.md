A zone is a group of spaces, partial spaces or other zones. Zone structures may not be hierarchical (in contrary to the spatial structure of a project - see _IfcSpatialStructureElement_), i.e. one individual _IfcSpace_ may be associated with zero, one, or several _IfcZone_'s. _IfcSpace_'s are grouped into an _IfcZone_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ as specified at the supertype _IfcGroup_.

> NOTE&nbsp; Certain use cases may restrict the freedom of non hierarchical relationships. In some building service use cases the zone denotes a view based delimited volume for the purpose of analysis and calculation. This type of zone cannot overlap with respect to that analysis, but may overlap otherwise.

> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The entity is now subtyped from _IfcSystem_ (not its supertype _IfcGroup_) with upward compatibility for file based exchange.
