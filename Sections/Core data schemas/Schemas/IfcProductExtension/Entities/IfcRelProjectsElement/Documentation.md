The _IfcRelProjectsElement_ is an objectified relationship between an element and one projection element that creates a modifier to the shape of the element. This relationship implies a Boolean operation of addition for the geometric bodies of the building element and the projection element.

The relationship is defined to be a 1:1 relationship, if a building element has more than one projection, several relationship objects have to be used, each pointing to a different projection element.
