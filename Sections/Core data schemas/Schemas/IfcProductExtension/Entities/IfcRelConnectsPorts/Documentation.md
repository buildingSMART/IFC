An _IfcRelConnectsPorts_ relationship defines the relationship that is made between two ports at their point of connection. It may include the connection geometry between two ports.

The objectified relationship _IfcRelConnectsPorts_ is required for defining how two instances of _IfcPort_ connect together. Each of the ports is logically contained within the _IfcDistributionElement_ by using the ordered collection _IfcRelNests_.
