An _IfcRelConnectsPorts_ defines the relationship that is made between two ports at their point of connection. It may include the connection geometry between two ports.

_IfcRelConnectsPorts_ is required for defining how instances of _IfcPort_ connect together. Each of the port is being logically attached to the _IfcElement_ by using the _IfcRelConnectsPortToElement_ relationship.
