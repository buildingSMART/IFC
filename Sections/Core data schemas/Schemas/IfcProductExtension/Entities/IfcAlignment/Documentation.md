An alignment is used to define a reference system to position elements mainly for linear construction works, such as roads, rails, bridges, and others. The relative positioning along the alignment is defined by the linear referencing methodology.

> NOTE&nbsp; See ISO 19148 Geographic information &ndash; Linear referencing for general definitions about linear referencing.

A single alignment may have:

* a horizontal alignment defined in the x/y plane of the engineering coordinate system
* an accompanying vertical alignment, defined along the horizontal alignment in the distance along / z coordinate space
* a relative alignment, defined as a span within another alignment and/or at constant or variable offsets
* a 3D alignment, either computed from the horizontal and vertical alignment, or extracted from geospatial data.

Alignments may be aggregated into referents (_IfcReferent_) or derivative alignments. Derivative alignments may be used to indicate dependent alignments, such as an alignment for a bridge that is relative to a parent alignment for a road, where the child _IfcAlignment_ may have _Axis_ set to _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ that starts and ends at a span within the extent of the _IfcAlignmentCurve_ defined at the _Axis_ of the parent _IfcAlignment_.

Alignments may be assigned to groups using _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_, where _IfcGroup_ or subtypes may capture information common to multiple alignments.

Supported representations of <span class="self-ref">IfcAlignment</span>.Axis are:

* _IfcAlignmentCurve_ as a 3D horizontal and vertical alignment (represented by their alignment segments)
* _IfcAlignmentCurve_ as a 2D horizontal alignment (represented by its horizontal alignment segments) without a vertical alignment
* _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_ as a 2D or 3D curve defined relative to an _IfcAlignmentCurve_ or another _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_
* _IfcPolyline_ as a 3D alignment by a 3D polyline representation (such as coming from a survey)
* _IfcPolyline_ as a 2D horizontal alignment by a 2D polyline representation (such as in very early planning phases or as a map representation)

> NOTE&nbsp; Although _Axis_ is an _IfcCurve_ base type, only derived types _IfcAlignmentCurve_, _IfcOffsetCurveByDistances_, and _IfcPolyline_ are meant to be supported types. Derivative specifications (Model View Definitions) may expand this set to include additional curve types.
