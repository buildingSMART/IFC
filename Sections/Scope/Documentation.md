This release of IFC specifies a conceptual data schema and an exchange file format for Building Information Model (BIM) data. The conceptual schema is defined in EXPRESS data specification language. The standard exchange file format for exchanging and sharing data according to the conceptual schema is using the Clear text encoding of the exchange structure. Alternative exchange file formats may be used if they conform to the conceptual schema.

{ .std}
This release of IFC represents an open international standard for BIM data that is exchanged and shared among software applications used by the various participants in a building construction or facility management project.

{ .std}
This release of IFC consists of the data schema, represented as an EXPRESS schema specification and alternatively as an XML schema specification, and reference data, represented as definitions of property and quantity names and descriptions.

{ .std}
A subset of the data schema and referenced data is referred to as a model view definition. A particular model view definition is defined to support one or many recognized workflows in the building construction and facility management industry sector. Each workflow identifies data exchange requirements for software applications. Conforming software applications need to identity the model view definition they conform to.

The following are outside the scope of this release of IFC:

{ .std}
* exchange format definitions outside of the domain of construction and facility maintenance; 
* full project structure and component breakdown structures outside of building engineering, but providing a baseline for civil engineering to be extended in future releases; 
* behavioral aspects of components and other information items.
