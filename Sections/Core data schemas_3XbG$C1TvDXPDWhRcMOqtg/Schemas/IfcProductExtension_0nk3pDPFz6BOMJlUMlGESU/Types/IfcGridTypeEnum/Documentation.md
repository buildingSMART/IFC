This enumeration defines the different layout types of grids. Restriction on the correct use of _IfcGrid_ instantiations may be imposed depending on the value of the _PredefinedType_ being _IfcGridTypeEnum_.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New enumeration in IFC4.

> NOTE&nbsp; View definitions or implementer agreements may impose further restrictions on how to populate the grid axes. The first grid axis being part of u-axes may have to be parallel to the x-axis of the grid object placement.
