The element type (_IfcTransportElementType_) defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of an element and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define an element specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

        defined as representation maps (at the level of the
        supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which gets assigned by
        an element occurrence instance through the
        <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
        <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</font>

A transport element type is used to define the common properties of a certain type of a transport element that may be applied to many instances of that type to assign a specific style. Transport element types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcTransportElementType_ are represented by instances of _IfcTransportElement_ (or its subtypes).
