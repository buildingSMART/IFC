_IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements_ defines a generic relationship that is made between two elements that require the realization of that relationship by means of further realizing elements.

An _IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements_ is a specialization of _IfcRelConnectsElement_ where the connecting operation has the additional attribute of (one or many) realizing elements that may be used to realize or further qualify the relationship. It is defined as a ternary relationship.

> <font size="-1">EXAMPLE: It may be used to describe the
        attachment of one element to another where the attachment
        is realized by a 'fixing' element such as a bracket. It
        may also be used to describe the mounting of one element
        onto another such as the requirement for the mounting
        major plant items onto builders work bases and/or
        anti-vibration isolators.</font>
