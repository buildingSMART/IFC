          Figure Â The insertion of a door into a wall is
          represented by two separate relationships. First the
          door opening is created within the wall by
          <i>IfcWall(StandardCase) o-- IfcRelVoidsElement --o
          IfcOpeningElement</i>, then the door is inserted within
          the opening by <i>IfcOpeningElement o--
          IfcRelFillsElement --o IfcDoor</i>.</small>")
