The building storey has an elevation and typically represents a (nearly) horizontal aggregation of spaces that are vertically bound.

A storey is (if specified) associated to a building. A storey may span over several connected storeys. Therefore storey complex provides for a collection of storeys included in a building. A storey can also be decomposed in (horizontical) parts, where each part defines a partial storey. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype _IfcSpatialStructureElements_ which is interpreted as follow:

* **COMPLEX**: building storey complex
* **ELEMENT**: building storey
* **PARTIAL**: partial building storey

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; In split level houses, a storey is split into two or more partial storeys, each with a different elevation. It can be handled by defining a storey, which includes two or more partial storeys with the individual elevations.

The _IfcBuildingStorey_ is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.

Figure 1 shows the _IfcBuildingStorey_ as part of the s patial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.

> NOTE&nbsp; Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.

Figure 2 describes the heights and elevations of the _IfcBuildingStorey_.

* elevation of storey provided by: _IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation_ as a local height value relative to _IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight_, it is usually the top of construction slab
* net height of storey, also referred to as total height or system height (top of construction slab to top of construction slab above): provided by BaseQuantity with Name="GrossHeight"
* net height of storey (top of construction slab to bottom of construction slab above): provided by BaseQuantity with Name="NetHeight"
