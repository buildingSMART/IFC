The building storey has an elevation and typically represents a (nearly) horizontal aggregation of spaces that are vertically bound.

A storey is (if specified) associated to a building. A storey may span over several connected storeys. Therefore storey complex provides for a collection of storeys included in a building. A storey can also be decomposed in (horizontical) parts, where each part defines a partial storey. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype _IfcSpatialStructureElements_ which is interpreted as follow:

* **COMPLEX**: building storey complex
* **ELEMENT**: building storey
* **PARTIAL**: partial building storey

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; In split level houses, a storey is split into two or more partial storeys, each with a different elevation. It can be handled by defining a storey, which includes two or more partial storeys with the individual elevations.

The _IfcBuildingStorey_ is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.

Figure 1 shows the _IfcBuildingStorey_ as part of the s patial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.

> NOTE&nbsp; Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.

If it refers to another instance ofÂ _IfcBuildingStorey_, the referenced _IfcBuildingStorey_ needs to have a different and lower _CompositionType_, i.e. ELEMENT (if the other _IfcBuildingStorey_ has COMPLEX), or PARTIAL (if the other _IfcBuildingStorey_ has ELEMENT).

> NOTE&nbsp; Multi storey spaces shall be spatially contained by only a single building storey, usually it is the building storey where the base of the space lies.

Spatial Container

The [Spatial Container](../../templates/spatial-container.htm) concept applies to this entity.

If there are building elements and/or other elements directly related to the _IfcBuildingStorey_ (like most building elements, such as walls, columns, etc.), they are associated with the _IfcBuildingStorey_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_. The _IfcBuildingStorey_ references them by its inverse relationship:

* _IfcBuildingStorey.ContainsElements_ -- referencing any subtype of _IfcProduct_ (with the exception of other spatial structure element) by _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure.RelatedElements_.

Elements can also be referenced in an _IfcBuildingStorey_, for example, if they span through several storeys. This is expressed by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_. Systems, such as building service or electrical distribution systems, zonal systems, or structural analysis systems, relate to _IfcBuildingStorey_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelServicesBuildings_.

Product Placement

The [Product Placement](../../templates/product-placement.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The local placement for _IfcBuildingStorey_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point (if relative placement is used) to the _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ of type _IfcBuilding_, or of type _IfcBuildingStorey_ (e.g. to position a building storey relative to a building storey complex, or a partial building storey to a building storey).
* If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
