An _IfcRelConnectsPortToElement_ defines the relationship that is made between a port and the _IfcElement_ in which it is contained. It is a 1 to 1 relationship.

Ports contained in different elements are connected to each other using the _IfcRelConnectsPorts_ relationship. Using both relationships, a topological system can be defined.
