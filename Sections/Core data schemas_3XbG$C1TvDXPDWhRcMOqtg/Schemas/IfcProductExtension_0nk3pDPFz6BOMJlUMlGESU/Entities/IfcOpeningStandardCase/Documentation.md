The standard opening, _IfcOpeningStandardCase_, defines an opening with certain constraints for the dimension parameters, position within the voided element, and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcOpeningStandardCase_ handles all cases of openings, that:

* are true openings where the opening depth is greather than or equal to the thickness of the element, and the _Predefinedtype_ is set correctly to .OPENING.
* are true recesses where the opening depth is lower than the thickness of the element, and the _Predefinedtype_ is set correctly to .RECESS.
* are extruded perpendicular to the wall plane in case of openings in a wall
* are extruded perpendicular to the slab plane in case of openings in a slab
* have a local placement relative to the local placement of the voided element
* have a 'Body' shape representation with 'SweptSolid' representation type
* have only a single extrusion body within the 'Body' shape representation
