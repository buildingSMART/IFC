The _IfcFeatureElementSubtraction_ is specialization of the general feature element, that represents an existence dependent elements which modifies the shape and appearance of the associated master element. The _IfcFeatureElementSubtraction_ offers the ability to handle shape modifiers as semantic objects within the IFC object model that subtract from the shape of the master element.

> NOTE&nbsp; A single subtraction feature such as the subtype _IfcOpeningElement_ is assigned by a single subtraction relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_ to one occurrences of _IfcElement_. It establishes a 1:1 relationship between the opening and the element. An element may have several _IfcRelVoidsElement_ relationships, enabling several voids.

The voiding relationship between a master element and a subtraction feature is geometrically resolved by a Boolean difference operation.

The local placement for _IfcFeatureElementSubtraction_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations. The local placement is always defined in relation to the local placement of the building element from which the feature element substration is substracted:

* The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point (if given) to the local placement of the same _IfcElement_, which is used in the _VoidsElements.RelatingElement_ inverse attribute.
