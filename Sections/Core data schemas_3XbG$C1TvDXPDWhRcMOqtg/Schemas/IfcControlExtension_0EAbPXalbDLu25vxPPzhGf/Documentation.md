The _IfcControlExtension_ schema in the core layer declares basic classes for control objects (_IfcControl_, _IfcPerformanceHistory_) and assignment of these (_IfcRelAssignsToControl_) to any object derived from _IfcObjectDefinition_. Also, it declares the classes to associate resource level objects of controlling nature to any subtype of _IfcRoot_, using _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_ and _IfcRelAssociatesApproval_.
