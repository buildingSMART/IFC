The _IfcProcessExtension_ schema provides the primary information that expands one of the key ideas of the IFC Model. This is the idea of 'process' which captures ideas about the mapping of processes in a logical sequence or planning and scheduling of work and the tasks required for its completion. It is important to understand that process information can be expressed by classes in exactly the same way as product information.

The _IfcProcessExtension_ schema extends the primary idea of the _IfcProcess_ outlined in the _IfcKernel_ schema. The objective of the _IfcProcessExtension_ schema is to capture information that supports the mapping of processes and the planning and scheduling of work and the procedures and resources required to carry out work. The aim is to provide support for information exchange and sharing within commonly used process mapping and scheduling applications; the extent of the model will not support the more detailed ideas found in more specialized applications.

The following are within the scope of this part of the specifications:

* definition of work plans including the tasks that are included within the plan and identification of the resources required by the plan, 
* definition of work schedules together with the elements that make up the schedule, the time constraints and durations applicable to the elements, 
* identification of work tasks and task types included in plans and schedules, 
* identification of procedures and procedure types that identify procedural steps required in response to an event, 
* identification of events and event types that identify points in a process at which a particular response is required, 
* identification of the relationship between a process and the resources that are consumed by the process, 
* allocation of resources to work plans, work schedules and work tasks.
