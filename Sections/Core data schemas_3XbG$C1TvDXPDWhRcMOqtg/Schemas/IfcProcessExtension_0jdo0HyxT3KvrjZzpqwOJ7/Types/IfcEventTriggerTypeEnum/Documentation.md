The _IfcEventTriggerTypeEnum_ defines the range of different types of event trigger that can be specified. The definition of event trigger types has been adopted from the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), which is also used in the Information Delivery Manual (IDM) for defining business processes. More detailed information about the use of event trigger types can be found in these specifications.
