_IfcProxy_ is intended to be a kind of a container for wrapping objects which are defined by associated properties, which may or may not have a geometric representation and placement in space. A proxy may have a semantic meaning, defined by the _Name_ attribute, and property definitions, attached through the property assignment relationship, which definition may be outside of the definitions given by the current release of IFC.

The _ProxyType_ may give an indication to which high level semantic breakdown of object the semantic definition of the proxy relates to. the _Tag_ attribute may be used to assign a human or system interpretable identifier (such as a serial number or bar code).

> NOTE&nbsp; Given that only a limited number of semantic constructs can be formally defined within IFC (and it will never be possible to define all), there has to be a mechanism for capturing those constructs that are not (yet) defined by IFC.

> NOTE&nbsp; Product proxies are a mechanism that allows to exchange data that is part of the project but not necessarily part of the IFC model. Those proxies may have geometric representations assigned.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC1.5.
