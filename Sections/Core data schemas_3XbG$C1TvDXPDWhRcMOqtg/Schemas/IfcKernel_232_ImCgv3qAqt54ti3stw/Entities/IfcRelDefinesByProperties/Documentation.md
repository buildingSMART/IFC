This objectified relationship (_IfcRelDefinesByProperties_) defines the relationships between property set definitions and objects. Properties are aggregated in property sets, property sets can be grouped to define an object type.

The _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ is a 1-to-N relationship, as it allows for the assignment of one property set to a single or to many objects. Those objects then share the same property definition.
