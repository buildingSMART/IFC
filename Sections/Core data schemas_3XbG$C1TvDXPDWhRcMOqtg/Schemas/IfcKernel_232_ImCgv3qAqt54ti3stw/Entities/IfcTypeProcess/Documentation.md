_IfcTypeProcess_ defines a specific (or type) definition of a process or activity without being assigned to a schedule or a time.Â It is used to define a process or activity specification, that is, the specific process or activity information that is common to all occurrences that are defined for that process or activity type.

An _IfcTypeProcess_ may have a list of property set attached. Values of these properties are common to all occurrences of that process or activity type. The type occurrence relationship is realized using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_.

Subtypes of _IfcTypeProcess_ may be exchanged without being already assigned to subtypes of _IfcProcess_.
