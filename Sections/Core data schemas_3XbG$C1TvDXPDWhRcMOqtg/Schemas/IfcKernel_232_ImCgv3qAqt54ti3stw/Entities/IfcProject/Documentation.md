_IfcProject_ indicates the undertaking of some design, engineering, construction, or maintenance activities leading towards a product. The project establishes the context for information to be exchanged or shared, and it may represent a construction project but does not have to. The _IfcProject_'s main purpose in an exchange structure is to provide the root instance and the context for all other information items included.

The context provided by the _IfcProject_ includes:

* the default units
* the geometric representation context for exchange structures including shape representations 
    * the world coordinate system
    * the coordinate space dimension
    * the precision used within the geometric representations, and
    * optionally the indication of the true north relative to the world coordinate system

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The attributes _RepresentationContexts_ and _UnitsInContext_ are made optional and are promoted to supertype _IfcContext_.

Informal Propositions:

1. There shall only be one project within the exchange context. This is enforced by the global rule _IfcSingleProjectInstance_.

Project Declaration

The [Project Declaration](../../templates/project-declaration.htm) concept applies to this entity as shown in Table 1.

The _IfcProject_ is also the context for other information about the construction project such as a work plan. Non-product structures are assigned by their first level object to _IfcProject_ using the _IfcRelDeclares_ relationship.

The _IfcProject_ provides the context for spatial elements and the associated products, and for work plans (or other non-product based) descriptions of the construction project. It is handled by two distinct relationship objects as shown in Figure 2.

> NOTE&nbsp; The spatial structure and the schedule structure can be decomposed. For example the _IfcBuilding_ can be decomposed into _IfcBuildingStorey_'s, and the _IfcWorkPlan_ can be decomposed into _IfcWorkSchedule_'s.

> NOTE&nbsp; The products and tasks can be decomposed further. For example the _IfcCurtainWall_ can be decomposed into _IfcMember_ and _IfcPlate_, the _IfcTask_ can be decomposed into other _IfcTask_'s.

> NOTE&nbsp; The products and tasks can have direct linking relationships. For example the _IfcCurtainWall_ can be assigned to a _IfcTask_ as an input or output for a construction schedule.

> NOTE&nbsp; The anomaly to use the composition structure through _IfcRelAggregates_ for assigning the uppermost spatial container to _IfcProject_ is due to upward compatibility reasons with earlier releases of this standard.

Figure 1 illustrates the context for project libraries that in return provide a context to the library items assigned to it. Product types are an example for items that can be included in a project library.

Spatial Decomposition

The [Spatial Decomposition](../../templates/spatial-decomposition.htm) concept applies to this entity as shown in Table 2.

The _IfcProject_ is used to reference the root of the spatial structure of a building or other construction project (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together, and to the _IfcProject_, by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.
