The _IfcControl_ is the abstract generalization of all concepts that control or constrain products or processes in general. It can be seen as a specification, regulation, cost schedule or other requirement applied to a product or process whose requirements and provisions must be fulfilled. Controls are assigned to products, processes, or other objects by using the _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship.

> <small>EXAMPLE&nbsp; Controls are e.g.,
space program, cost schedules, order, work plan, etc.<br>
NOTE&nbsp; Some basic items,
such as cost value, approval, or constraint are directly attachable to
products and processes using the association relationship subtypes of <i>IfcRelAssociates</i>.</small>
