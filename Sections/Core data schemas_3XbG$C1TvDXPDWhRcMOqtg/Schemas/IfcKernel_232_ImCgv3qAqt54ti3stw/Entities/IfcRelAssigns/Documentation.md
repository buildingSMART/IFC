The assignment relationship, _IfcRelAssigns_, is a generalization of "link" relationships among instances of _IfcObject_ and its various 1^st^ level subtypes. A link denotes the specific association through which one object (the client) applies the services of other objects (the suppliers), or through which one object may navigate to other objects.

The client is denoted as the relating object and is established at the level of the specific, instantiable subtypes of _IfcRelAssigns_. The suppliers are denoted as the related objects and they are established by the _RelatedObjects_ attribute.

> NOTE&nbsp; The terms "client" and "supplier" are used in a general concept and do not imply any meaning for implementations of systems (like client-server).

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; A resource may receive information about its nature of representing real building products by establishing a link between _IfcResource_ and _IfcBuildingElement_ (subtype of _IfcProduct_) through the assignment relationship _IfcRelAssignsToResource_. The resource is then the client that applies the services of other objects (here building elements) to express the particular view of elements to be consumed as a resource in a process.

The assignment relationship establishs a bi-directional relationship among the participating objects and does not imply any dependency. The subtypes of _IfcRelAssigns_ establishes the particular semantic meaning of the assignment relationship.
