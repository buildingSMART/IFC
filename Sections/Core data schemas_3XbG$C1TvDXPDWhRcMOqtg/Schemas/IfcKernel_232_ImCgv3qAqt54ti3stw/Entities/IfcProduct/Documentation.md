The _IfcProduct_ is an abstract representation of any object that relates to a geometric or spatial context. An _IfcProduct_ occurs at a specific location in space if it has a geometric representation assigned. It can be placed relatively to other products, but ultimately relative to the project coordinate system. The _ObjectPlacement_ attribute establishes the coordinate system in which all points and directions used by the geometric representation items under _Representation_ are founded. The _Representation_ is provided by an _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ being either a geometric shape representation, or a topology representation (with or without underlying geometry of the topological items).

Products include manufactured, supplied or created objects (referred to as elements) for incorporation into an AEC/FM project. This also includes objects that are created indirectly by other products, as spaces are defined by bounding elements. Products can be designated for permanent use or temporary use, an example for the latter is formwork. Products are defined by their properties and representations.

In addition to physical products (covered by the subtype _IfcElement_) and spatial items (covered by the subtype _IfcSpatialElement_) the _IfcProduct_ also includes non-physical items, that relate to a geometric or spatial contexts, such as grid, port, annotation, structural actions, etc.

Any instance of _IfcProduct_ defines a particular occurrence of a product, the common type information, that relates to many similar (or identical) occurrences of _IfcProduct_, is handled by the _IfcTypeProduct_ (and its subtypes), assigned to one or many occurrences of _IfcProduct_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelDefinesByType_. The _IfcTypeProduct_ may provide, in addition to common properties, also a common geometric representation for all occurrences.

> NOTE&nbsp; See _IfcTypeProduct_ for how to use a common geometric representation and _IfcRelDefinesByType_ for using and overriding common properties.

On a generic level products can be assigned to processes, controls, resources, project by using the relationship objects that refer to the corresponding object:

* **Having a control applied**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcControl_
* **Being assigned to a process**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcProcess_
* **Being assigned to a resource**: assigned using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ linking the _IfcProduct_ to an _IfcResource_

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; An example of the control relationship is the assignment of a performance history to a distribution element. An example of process assignment relationship is the assignment of products like wall, slab, column to a contruction task for construction planning. And an example of resource assignment relationship is the assignment of products to a construction resource that consumes the product.
