The objectified relationship _IfcRelAssignsToActor_ handles the assignment of objects (subtypes of _IfcObject_) to an actor (subtypes of _IfcActor_).

The _IfcRelAssignsToActor_ objectified relationship defines a relationship between an _IfcActor_ and one or many objects. A particular role of the actor played in that relationship can be associated. If specified, it takes priority over the role that may be directly assigned to the person or organization.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; An occupant (as an actor) may rent a flat (as a collection of spaces or a zone). This would be an application of this generic relationship.

Reference to the objects (or single object) on which the actor acts upon in a certain role (if given) is specified in the inherited _RelatedObjects_ attribute.
