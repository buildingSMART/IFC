The schema _IfcSharedComponentElements_ provides the ability to represent different kinds of small parts, such as various accessories and fasteners. The schema contains the entity _IfcElementComponent_, a subtype of _IfcElement_ from schema _IfcProductExtensions_, and relevant subtypes for fasteners, mechanical fasteners and discrete accessories along with their corresponding type objects. The schema also includes special subtypes of _IfcFeatureElementSubtraction_ in order to provide the ability to represent building element edge forms as features.
