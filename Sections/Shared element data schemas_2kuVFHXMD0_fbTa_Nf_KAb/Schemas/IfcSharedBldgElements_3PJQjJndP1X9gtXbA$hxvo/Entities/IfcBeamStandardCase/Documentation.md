The standard beam, _IfcBeamStandardCase_, defines a beam with certain constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcBeamStandardCase_ handles all cases of beams, that:

* have a reference to the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ defining the material profile association of the beam with the cardinal point of its insertion relative to the local placement.
* are consistent in using the correct cardinal point offset of the profile as compared to the 'Axis' and 'Body' shape representation
* are based on a sweep of a planar profile, or set of profiles, as defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_
* have an 'Axis' shape representation with constraints provided below in the geometry use definition
* have a 'Body' shape representation with constraints provided below in the geometry use definition 
    * are extruded perpendicular to the profile definition plane
    * have a start profile, or set of profiles, that is swept
    * the sweeping operation can be linear extrusion, circular rotation, or a sweep along a directrix
    * the start profile, or set of profiles can be swept unchanged, or might be changed uniformly by a taper definition 
*  
>> NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, e.g. by excluding tapering from an _IfcBeamStandardCase_ implementation.

**_Geometric Representations_**

The geometric representation of _IfcBeamStandardCase_ is defined using the following multiple shape representations for its definition:

* **Axis**: A three dimensional open curve (subtype of _IfcBoundedCurve_) defining the axis for the standard beam. The cardinal point is determined by the beam axis.
* **Body**: A Swept Solid Representation or a CSG clipping representation defining the 3D shape of the standard beam.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is invalid to exchange a 'SurfaceModel', 'Brep', or 'MappedRepresentation' representation for the 'Body' shape representation of an _IfcBeamStandardCase_.
