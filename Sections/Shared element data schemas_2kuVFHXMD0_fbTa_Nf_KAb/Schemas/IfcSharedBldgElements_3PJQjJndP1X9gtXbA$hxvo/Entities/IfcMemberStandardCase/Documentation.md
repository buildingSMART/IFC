The standard member, _IfcMemberStandardCase_, defines a member with certain constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcMemberStandardCase_ handles all cases of members, that:

* have a reference to the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ defining the material profile association of the member with the cardinal point of its insertion relative to the local placement.
* are based on a sweep of a planar profile, or set of profiles, as defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_
* have an 'Axis' shape representation with constraints provided below in the geometry use definition
* have a 'Body' shape representation with constraints provided below in the geometry use definition
* have a start profile, or set of profiles, that is swept along the directrix and might be changed uniformly by a taper definition
* are consistent in using the correct cardinal point offset of the profile as compared to the 'Axis' and 'Body' shape representation
* are extruded perpendicular to the profile definition plane

> NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, such as by excluding tapering from an _IfcMemberStandardCase_ implementation.

Object Typing

The [Object Typing](../../templates/object-typing.htm) concept applies to this entity as shown in Table 1.

</table>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p class="table">Table 1 &mdash; IfcMemberStandardCase Object Typing</p></td></tr></table>

The _IfcMemberStandardCase_ defines in addition that the _IfcMemberType_ should have a unique _IfcMaterialProfileSet_, that is referenced by the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ assigned to all occurrences of this _IfcMemberType_.

  
  
{ .use-head}
Material Profile Set Usage

The [Material Profile Set Usage](../../templates/material-profile-set-usage.htm) concept applies to this entity.

Figure 1 illustrates assignment of _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ and _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ to the _IfcMemberStandardCase_ as the member occurrence and to the _IfcMemberType_. The same _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ shall be shared by many occurrences of _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_. This relationship shall be consistent to the relationship between the _IfcMemberType_ and the _IfcMemberStandardCase_.

!["Material profile set and usage"](../../../figures/IfcMemberStandardCase-01.png "Figure 1 &mdash; Member profile usage")

Figure 2 illustrates assignment of a composite profile by using _IfcCompositeProfile_ for geometric representation and several _IfcMaterialProfile_'s within the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_. The number of _IfcMaterialProfile_'s within the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is restricted to maximal 2 and requires the use of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered_, or _IfcRevolvedAreaSolidTapered_ for the correct 'Body' shape representation.

!["Material profile set and usage"](../../../figures/IfcMemberStandardCase-02.png "Figure 2 &mdash; Member composite profiles")

The material of the _IfcMemberStandardCase_ is defined by _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship. Composite profile members can be represented by refering to several _IfcMaterialProfile_'s within the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ that is referenced from the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_.

Material information can also be given at the _IfcMemberType_, defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type. It is then accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ relationship pointing to _IfcMemberType.HasAssociations_ and via _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_. See **Type Use
Definition** for additional agreements for standard members.

Body SweptSolid Geometry

The [Body SweptSolid Geometry](../../templates/body-sweptsolid-geometry.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The following additional constraints apply to the 'SweptSolid' representation:

* **Solid**: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ shall be supported
* **Profile**: all subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_)

* **Extrusion**: perpendicular to the profile direction.
* **Orientation**: The y-axis of the profile, as determined by _IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position.P[2]_ shall point to the Z-Axis. It indicates the "role" of the column, a role=0&deg; means y-axis of profile = Z-axis of reference coordinate system. In the exception of a vertical member, the y-axis shall point to the Y-axis.

Figure 5 illustrates a 'SweptSolid' geometric representation with cardinal point applied as **1** (bottom left).

The following interpretation of dimension parameter applies for rectangular members:
