Shading devices are purpose built devices to protect from the sunlight, from natural light, or screening them from view. Shading devices can form part of the facade or can be mounted inside the building, they can be fixed or operable.

> NOTE&nbsp; Also other building elements such as protruding slabs or balconies can act as shading devices. Those elements however have another primary purpose and are defined as _IfcSlab_ or by other subtypes of _IfcBuildingElement_.
