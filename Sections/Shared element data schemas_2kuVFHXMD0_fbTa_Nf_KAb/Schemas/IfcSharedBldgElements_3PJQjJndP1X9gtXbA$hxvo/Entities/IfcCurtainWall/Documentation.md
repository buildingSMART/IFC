A curtain wall is an exterior wall of a building which is an assembly of components, hung from the edge of the floor/roof structure rather than bearing on a floor. Curtain wall is represented as a building element assembly and implemented as a subtype of _IfcBuildingElement_ that uses an _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.

The geometric representation of _IfcCurtainWall_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, allowing multiple geometric representations. Independent 'Body' geometric representation, as described below, should only be used when the _IfcCurtainWall_ is not defined as an aggregate. If defined as an aggregate, the geometric representation is the sum of the representations of the components within the aggregate.

The geometric representation of _IfcCurtainWall_ is defined using the following multiple shape representations for its definition:

* Axis: A two-dimensional open curve (for restrictions see below) defining the axis for the curtain wall. 
    * This is an optional representation for curtain walls. 
* Body: A surface model or boundary representation model representation defining the 3D shape of the curtain wall. 
    * If the _IfcCurtainWall_ has components (referenced by _SELF\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy_) then no independent shape representation with _RepresentationType_ = 'Body' shall be defined. The body of _IfcCurtainWall_ is then geometrically represented by the shape representation of its components. The components are accessed via _SELF\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy[1].RelatedObjects_. 
    * If the _IfcCurtainWall_ has no components defined (empty set of _SELF\IfcObject.IsDecomposedBy_) then the _IfcCurtainWall_ may be represented by an shape representation with the _RepresentationIdentifier_ ='Body'.
