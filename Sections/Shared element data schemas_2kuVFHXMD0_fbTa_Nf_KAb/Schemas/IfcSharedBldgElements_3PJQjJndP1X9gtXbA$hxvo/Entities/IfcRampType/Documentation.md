The building element type **IfcRampType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of ramps. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements

It is used to define a ramp type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcRampType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcRampType** are represented by instances of _IfcRamp_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcRamp_ for supported property sets, materials, and composition.
