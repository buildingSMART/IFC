The element type _IfcSlabType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of slabs. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common material layer definitions
* common shape representations

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to share shape representations as representation maps for occurrences of _IfcSlabStandardCase_.

It is used to define a slab specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type). Slab types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

> NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as representation maps (at the level of the supertype _IfcTypeProduct_, which gets assigned by an element occurrence instance through the _IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]_ being an _IfcMappedItem_.

The occurrences of the _IfcSlabType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcSlabStandardCase_ if the _IfcSlabType_ has a single associated _IfcMaterialLayerSet_; otherwise they are represented by instances of _IfcSlab_, or _IfcSlabElementedCase_.
