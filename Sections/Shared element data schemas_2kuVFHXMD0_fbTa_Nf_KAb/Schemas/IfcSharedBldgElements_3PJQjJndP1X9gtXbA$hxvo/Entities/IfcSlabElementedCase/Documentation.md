The _IfcSlabElementedCase_ defines a slab with certain constraints for the provision of its components. The _IfcSlabElementedCase_ handles all cases of slabs, that are decomposed into parts:

* having components being assigned to the _IfcSlabElementedCase_ using the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship accessible by the inverse relationship _IsDecomposedBy_.
* applying the constraint that the parts within the decomposition shall be of type _IfcElementAssembly_, _IfcBeam_, _IfcMember_, _IfcPlate_, _IfcBuildingElementPart_ or _IfcBuildingElementProxy_.

Voiding Use Definition:

As shown in Figure 1, openings within the composite slab are directly assigned to _IfcSlabElementedCase_ using _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcOpeningElement_ and apply to all aggregated parts. If individual parts have cutting and other voiding features, then the decomposed parts have a separate voiding relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcVoidingFeature_.
