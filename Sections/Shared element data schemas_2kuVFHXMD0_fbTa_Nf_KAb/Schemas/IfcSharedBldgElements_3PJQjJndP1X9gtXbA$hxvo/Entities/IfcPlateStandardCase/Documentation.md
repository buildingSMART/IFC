The standard plate, _IfcPlateStandardCase_, defines a plate with certain constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcPlateStandardCase_ handles all cases of plates, that:

* have a reference to the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ defining the material layers of the plate with thicknesses
* are based on an extrusion of a planar surface as defined by the plate profile
* have a constant thickness along the extrusion direction
* are consistent in using the correct material layer set offset to the base planar surface in regard to the shape representation
* are extruded perpendicular to the plane surface

The definitions of plate openings and niches are the same as given at the supertype _IfcPlate_. The same agreements to the special types of plates, as defined in the _PredefinedType_ attribute apply as well.
