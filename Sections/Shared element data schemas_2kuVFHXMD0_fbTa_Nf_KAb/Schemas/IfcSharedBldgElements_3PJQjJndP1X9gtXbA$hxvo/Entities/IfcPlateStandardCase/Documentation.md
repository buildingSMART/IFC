The standard plate, _IfcPlateStandardCase_, defines a plate with certain constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcPlateStandardCase_ handles all cases of plates, that:

* have a reference to the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ defining the material layers of the plate with thicknesses
* are based on an extrusion of a planar surface as defined by the plate profile
* have a constant thickness along the extrusion direction
* are consistent in using the correct material layer set offset to the base planar surface in regard to the shape representation
* are extruded perpendicular to the plane surface

The definitions of plate openings and niches are the same as given at the supertype _IfcPlate_. The same agreements to the special types of plates, as defined in the _PredefinedType_ attribute apply as well.

Material Layer Set Usage

The [Material Layer Set Usage](../../templates/material-layer-set-usage.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The material of the _IfcPlateStandardCase_ is defined by _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship. Multi-layer plates can be represented by refering to several _IfcMaterialLayer_'s within the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ that is referenced from the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_.&nbsp;

Material information can also be given at the _IfcPlateType_, defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type.&nbsp;It is then accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ relationship pointing to _IfcPlateType.HasAssociations_ and via _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_.

The _IfcPlateStandardCase_ defines in addition that the _IfcPlateType_ should have a unique _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, that is referenced by the&nbsp;_IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ assigned to all occurrences of this _IfcPlateType_.

Figure 1 illustrates assignment of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ and _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ to the _IfcPlateStandardCase_ as the plate occurrence and to the _IfcPlateType_. The same _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ shall be shared by many occurrences of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_. This relationship shall be consistent to the relationship between the _IfcPlateType_ and the _IfcPlateStandardCase_.

As shown in Figure 106, the following conventions shall be met:

* The reference coordinate system is the coordinate system established by the _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Position_.
* The reference plane is the plane defined by the extruded profile of _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.SweptSolid_. The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ is given as a distance from this plane.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.DirectionSense_ defines how the _IfcMaterialLayer_'s are assigned to the reference plane. POSITIVE means in direction to the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ is the distance parallel to the reference plane and always perpendicular to the base (XY) plane of the reference coordinate system. This is independent of a potential non-perpendicular extrusion given by _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.ExtrudedDirection_ &lt;&gt; 0.,0.,1. A positive value of _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.OffsetFromReferenceLine_ would then point into the positive z-axis of the reference coordinate system.
* The _Thickness_ of each _IfcMaterialLayer_ shall be the parallel distance (measured perpendicular to the base plane). The _TotalThickness_ of the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ is the sum of all layer thicknesses and in case of a perpendicular extrusion identical with _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid.Depth_
* The _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage.LayerSetDirection_ i always AXIS3.

Product Placement

The [Product Placement](../../templates/product-placement.htm) concept applies to this entity as shown in Table 1.

The following restriction is imposed:

* The local placement shall provide the location and directions for the standard plate, the x/y plane is the plane for the profile, and the z-axis is the extrusion axis for the plate body.

Body SweptSolid Geometry

The [Body SweptSolid Geometry](../../templates/body-sweptsolid-geometry.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The following additional constraints apply to the swept solid representation:

* **Solid**: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ is required,
* **Profile**: _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef, IfcRectangleProfileDef, IfcRoundedRectangleProfileDef, IfcCircleProfileDef, IfcEllipseProfileDef_ shall be supported.
* **Extrusion**: The profile can be extruded perpendicularly or non-perpendicularly to the plane of the swept profile.
* **Material**: The definition of the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_, particularly of the _OffsetFromReferenceLine_ and the _ForLayerSet.TotalThickness_, has to be consistent to the 'SweptSolid' representation.
