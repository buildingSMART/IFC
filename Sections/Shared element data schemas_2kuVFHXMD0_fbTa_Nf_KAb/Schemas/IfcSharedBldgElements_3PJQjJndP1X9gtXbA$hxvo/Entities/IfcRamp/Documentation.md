A ramp is a vertical passageway which provides a human circulation link between one floor level and another floor level at a different elevation. It may include a landing as an intermediate floor slab. A ramp normally does not include steps.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1: Inclined way or floor joining two surfaces at different levels.

The _IfcRamp_ shall either be represented:

* as a ramp assembly that aggregates all components (ramp flight, landing, etc.) with own representations, or
* as a single ramp without decomposition including all representations directly at the ramp entity.

> NOTE&nbsp; In case of an _IfcRamp_ being the aggregate of all components of the ramp the aggregation is handled by the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship, relating an _IfcRamp_ with the related _IfcRampFlight_ and landings, _IfcSlab_ with PredefinedType=LANDING. _IfcRailing_'s belonging to the ramp may also be included into the aggregation.

The geometric representation of _IfcRamp_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, allowing multiple geometric representations. Independent 'Body' geometric representations should only be used when the _IfcRamp_ is not defined as an aggregate. If defined as an aggregate, the 'Body' geometric representation is the sum of the representation of the components within the ramp aggregate.

Material Single

The [Material Single](../../templates/material-single.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The material of the _IfcRamp_ is defined by the _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

Material information can also be given at the _IfcRampType_, defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type.Â It is then accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ relationship pointing to _IfcRampType.HasAssociations_ and via _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_ to _IfcMaterial_. If both are given, then the material directly assigned to _IfcRamp_ overrides the material assigned to _IfcRampType_.

Spatial Containment

The [Spatial Containment](../../templates/spatial-containment.htm) concept applies to this entity as shown in Table 3.

The _IfcRamp_, as any subtype of _IfcBuildingElement_, may participate alternatively in one of the two different containment relationships:

* the _Spatial Containment_ (defined here), or
* the _Element Composition_.

Element Decomposition

The [Element Decomposition](../../templates/element-decomposition.htm) concept applies to this entity as shown in Table 4.

If the _IfcRamp_ has components (referenced by _SELF\IfcProduct.IsDecomposedBy_) then no independent 'Body' geometric representation shall be defined for the _IfcRamp_. The _IfcRamp_ is then geometrically represented by the geometric representation of its components.
