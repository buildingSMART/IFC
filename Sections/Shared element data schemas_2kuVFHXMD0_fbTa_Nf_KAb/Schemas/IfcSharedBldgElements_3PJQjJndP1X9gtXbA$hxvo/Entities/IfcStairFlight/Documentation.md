A stair flight is an assembly of building components in a single "run" of stair steps (not interrupted by a landing). The stair steps and any stringers are included in the stair flight. A winder is also regarded a part of a stair flight.

An _IfcStairFlight_ is normally aggregated by an _IfcStair_ through the _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship, the stair flight is then included in the set of _IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects_. An _IfcStairFlight_ normally connects the floor slab of zero to two different storeys (or partial storeys, or landings) within a building. The connection relationship between the _IfcStairFlight_ and the _IfcSlab_ can be expressed using the _IfcRelConnectsElements_ relationship.
