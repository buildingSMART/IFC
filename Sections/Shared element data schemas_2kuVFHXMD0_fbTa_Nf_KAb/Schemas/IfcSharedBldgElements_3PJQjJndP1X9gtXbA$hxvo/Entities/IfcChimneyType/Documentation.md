The building element type **IfcChimneyType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of chimneys. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements

It is used to define a chimney type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcChimneyType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcChimneyType** are represented by instances of _IfcChimney_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcChimney_ for supported property sets, materials, and composition.
