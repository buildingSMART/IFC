The element type _IfcColumnType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of columns. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties within shared property sets
* common material information
* common profile definitions
* common shape representations

It is used to define a column specification, or column style (i.e. the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that column type). Column types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcColumnType_ within building models are represented by instances of _IfcColumnStandardCase_ if the _IfcColumnType_ has a single associated _IfcMaterialProfileSet_; otherwise they are represented by instances of _IfcColumn_. Occurrences of the _IfcColumnType_ within structural analysis models are represented by instances of _IfcStructuralCurveMember_, or its applicable subtypes.
