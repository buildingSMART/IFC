The standard column, _IfcColumnStandardCase_, defines a column with certain constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcColumnStandardCase_ handles all cases of columns, that:

<ul>
<li>have a reference to the <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em>
defining the material profile association of the column with the
cardinal point of its insertion relative to the local
placement.</li>
<li>are based on a sweep of a planar profile, or set of profiles,
as defined by the <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em></li>
<li>have an 'Axis' shape representation with constraints provided
below in the geometry use definition</li>
<li>have a 'Body' shape representation with constraints provided
below in the geometry use definition</li>
<li>have a start profile, or set of profiles, that is swept along
the directrix and might be changed uniformly by a taper
definition</li>
<li>are consistent in using the correct cardinal point offset of
the profile as compared to the 'Axis' and 'Body' shape
representation</li>
<li>are extruded perpendicular to the profile definition
plane</li>
<li style="list-style-type:none">
<blockquote class="note"><small>NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementer
agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types,
e.g. by excluding tapering from an <em>IfcBeamStandardCase</em>
implementation.</small></blockquote>

**_Geometric Representations_**

The geometric representation of _IfcColumnStandardCase_ is defined using the following multiple shape representations for its definition:

* **Axis**: A three-dimensional open curve (subtype of _IfcBoundedCurve_) defining the axis for the standard column. The cardinal point is determined by the column axis.
* **Body**: A Swept Solid Representation or a CSG representation defining the 3D shape of the standard column.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is invalid to exchange a 'SurfaceModel', 'Brep', or 'MappedRepresentation' representation for the 'Body' shape representation of an _IfcColumnStandardCase_.
