The standard slab, _IfcSlabStandardCase_, defines a slab with certain constraints for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The _IfcSlabStandardCase_ handles all cases of slabs, that:

* have a reference to the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ defining the material layers of the slab with thicknesses
* are based on an extrusion of a planar surface as defined by the slab profile
* have a constant thickness along the extrusion direction
* are consistent in using the correct material layer set offset to the base planar surface in regard to the shape representation
* are extruded either perpendicular or slanted to the plane surface

The definitions of slab openings and niches are the same as given at the supertype _IfcSlab_. The same agreements to the special types of slabs, as defined in the _PredefinedType_ attribute apply as well.

> NOTE&nbsp; If the _IfcSlabStandardCase_ is of type Landing and is used within an _IfcStair_ or _IfcRamp_, the special agreements to handle stair and ramp geometry will also affect the geometric representation of the _IfcSlabStandardCase_.
