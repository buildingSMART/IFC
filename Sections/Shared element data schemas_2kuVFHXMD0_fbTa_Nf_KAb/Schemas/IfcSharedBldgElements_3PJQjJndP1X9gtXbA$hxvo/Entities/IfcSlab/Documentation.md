A slab is a component of the construction that normally encloses a space vertically. The slab may provide the lower support (floor) or upper construction (roof slab) in any space in a building.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1  
> thick, flat or shaped component, usually larger than 300 mm square, used to form a covering or projecting from a building.

Only the core or constructional part of this construction is considered to be a slab. The upper finish (flooring, roofing) and the lower finish (ceiling, suspended ceiling) are considered to be coverings. A special type of slab is the landing, described as a floor section to which one or more stair flights or ramp flights connect.

> NOTE&nbsp; There is a representation of slabs for structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of _IfcStructuralMember_ being part of the _IfcStructuralAnalysisModel_.

> NOTE&nbsp; An arbitrary planar element to which this semantic information is not applicable or irrelevant shall be modeled as _IfcPlate_.

A slab may have openings, such as floor openings, or recesses. They are defined by an _IfcOpeningElement_ attached to the slab using the inverse relationship _HasOpenings_ pointing to _IfcRelVoidsElement_.

There are three entities for slab occurrences:

* _IfcSlabStandardCase_ used for all occurrences of slabs, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully described by the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_. These slabs are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ assigned.
* _IfcSlabElementedCase_ used for occurrences of slabs which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of _IfcRelAggregates_ relationship.
* _IfcSlab_ used for all other occurrences of slabs, particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non planar surfaces, and slabs having only 'SweptSolid' or 'Brep' geometry.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0; it is a merger of the two previous entities IfcFloor, IfcRoofSlab, introduced in IFC1.0

Material Layer Set

The [Material Layer Set](../../templates/material-layer-set.htm) concept applies to this entity.

The material of the _IfcSlab_ is defined by _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcSlabType_.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to assign an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ to an _IfcSlab_. Only the subtype _IfcSlabStandardCase_ supports this concept.
