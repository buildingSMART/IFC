The element type _IfcDistributionChamberElementType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a distribution chamber element and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a distribution chamber element specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

> <font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A distribution chamber element type is used to define the common properties of a distribution chamber element that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A distribution chamber element is a formed volume used in a distribution system, such as a sump, trench or manhole. Distribution chamber element types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcDistributionChamberElementType_ are represented by instances of _IfcDistributionElement_ or its subtypes.
