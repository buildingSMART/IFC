A distribution chamber element defines a place at which distribution systems and their constituent elements may be inspected or through which they may travel.

An **IfcDistributionChamberElement** is a formed volume used in a distribution system, such as a sump, trench or manhole. Instances of [IfcDistributionSystem](../../ifcsharedbldgserviceelements/lexical/ifcdistributionsystem.htm) or [IfcDistributionFlowElement](../../ifcsharedbldgserviceelements/lexical/ifcdistributionflowelement.htm) may be related to the **IfcDistributionChamberElement** enabling their location in or at the chamber to be determined.
