An occupant is a type of actor that defines the form of occupancy of a property.

The principal purpose of **IfcOccupant** is to determine the nature of occupancy of a property for a particular actor. All characteristics relating to the actor (name and organization details) are inherited from the _IfcActor_ entity.
