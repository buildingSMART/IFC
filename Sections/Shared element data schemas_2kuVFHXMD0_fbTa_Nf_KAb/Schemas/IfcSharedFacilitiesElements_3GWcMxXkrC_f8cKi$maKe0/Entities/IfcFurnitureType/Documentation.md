The furnishing element type **IfcFurnitureType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of furnitures. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements

It is used to define a furniture type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcFurnitureType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcFurnitureType** are represented by instances of _IfcFurniture_. Refer to the documentation at _IfcFurniture_ for supported property sets, materials, and composition.
