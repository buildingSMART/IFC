A junction box is an enclosure within which cables are connected.

Cables may be members of an electrical circuit (for electrical power systems) or be information carriers (in a telecommunications system). A junction box is typically intended to conceal a cable junction from sight, eliminate tampering or provide a safe place for electrical connection.
