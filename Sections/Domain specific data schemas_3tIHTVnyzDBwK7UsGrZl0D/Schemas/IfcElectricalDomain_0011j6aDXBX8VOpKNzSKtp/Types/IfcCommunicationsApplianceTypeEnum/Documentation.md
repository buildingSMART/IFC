* **ANTENNA**: A transducer designed to transmit or receive electromagnetic waves.
* **COMPUTER**: A desktop, laptop, tablet, or other type of computer that can be moved from one place to another and connected to an electrical supply via a plugged outlet.
* **FAX**: A machine that has the primary function of transmitting a facsimile copy of printed matter using a telephone line.
* **GATEWAY**: A gateway connects multiple network segments with different protocols at all layers (layers 1-7) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
* **MODEM**: A modem (from modulator-demodulator) is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information, and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information
* **NETWORKAPPLIANCE**: A network appliance performs a dedicated function such as firewall protection, content filtering, load balancing, or equipment management.
* **NETWORKBRIDGE**: A network bridge connects multiple network segments at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model, and the term layer 2 switch is very often used interchangeably with bridge
