****Property Set Use Definition****:

The property sets relating to the _IfcReinforcingMesh_ are defined by the _IfcPropertySet_ and attached by the _IfcRelDefinesByProperties_ relationship. It is accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ relationship. The following property set definitions specific to the _IfcReinforcingMesh_ are part of this IFC release:

* [Pset_ReinforcingBarBendingsBECCommon](../../psd/IfcStructuralElementsDomain/Pset_ReinforcingBarBendingsBECCommon.xml){ target="SOURCE"}: common property set for all _IfcReinforcingMesh_ occurrences for bending information according to the Finnish BEC-standard. 

**Geometry Use Definitions:**

The geometric representation of _IfcReinforcinMesh_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, allowing multiple geometric representations. Included are:

**Local Placement**  
The use of local placement is defined in the supertype _IfcBuildingElementComponent_.

**Standard Geometric Representation**  
The use of Standard Geometric Representations is defined in the supertype _IfcBuildingElementComponent_.
