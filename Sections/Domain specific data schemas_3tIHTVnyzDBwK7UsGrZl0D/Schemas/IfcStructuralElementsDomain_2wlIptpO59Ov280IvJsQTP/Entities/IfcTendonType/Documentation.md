The reinforcing element type **IfcTendonType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of tendons. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements

It is used to define a tendon type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcTendonType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcTendonType** are represented by instances of _IfcTendon_.

Material Use Definition

An associated material denotes the steel grade, preferrably via material classification. A material constituent set or material profile set may be associated if the cable, bonding mortar or corrosion protection, and tendon sheeth are to be described together by the material association.

Geometry Use Definition

The _IfcTendonType_ may define the shared geometric representation for many tendon occurrences. The _RepresentationMaps_ attribute refers to a list of _IfcRepresentationMap_'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations.
