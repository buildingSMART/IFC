The reinforcing element type **IfcReinforcingMeshType** defines commonly shared information for occurrences of reinforcing meshs. The set of shared information may include:

* common properties with shared property sets
* common representations
* common materials
* common composition of elements

It is used to define a reinforcing mesh type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. The **IfcReinforcingMeshType** may be declared within _IfcProject_ or _IfcProjectLibrary_ using _IfcRelDeclares_ and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of **IfcReinforcingMeshType** are represented by instances of _IfcReinforcingMesh_.

Geometry Use Definition

The _IfcReinforcingMeshType_ may define the shared geometric representation for many mesh occurrences. The _RepresentationMaps_ attribute refers to a list of _IfcRepresentationMap_'s, that allow for multiple geometric representations.
