The interaction requirement (_IfcRelInteractionRequirements_) is provided as a relationship that defines the requirements for the interaction (adjacency) of two spaces in the architectural program.

In addition the relationship can define the interaction between two parties, such as persons, departments, organizations, that are associated to the space programs (interaction relations between workstations, workstation groups, floor blocks, or spaces, are defined through their associated space programs).

The interaction requirement is encoded as an normalised ratio measure between 0 and 1.

> <font size="-1">Note: The work interaction relationship can be used
		  for defining the adjacency between space programs as well as spaces. A work
		  interaction instance can be created by an architectural space design program or
		  a facilities management space planning program. By storing the work interaction
		  instances in the central model of the building project supported by IFCs, it
		  can be reused when spaces need to be re-designed, re-modeled, or people need to
		  move offices, etc. </font>
