A waste terminal has the purpose of collecting or intercepting waste from one or more sanitary terminals or other fluid waste generating equipment and discharging it into a single waste/drainage system.

A waste terminal provides for all forms of trap and waste point that collects discharge from a sanitary terminal and discharges it into a waste/drainage subsystem or that collects waste from several terminals and passes it into a single waste/drainage subsystem. This includes the P and S traps from soil sanitary terminals, sinks, and basins as well as floor wastes and gully traps that provide collection points.
