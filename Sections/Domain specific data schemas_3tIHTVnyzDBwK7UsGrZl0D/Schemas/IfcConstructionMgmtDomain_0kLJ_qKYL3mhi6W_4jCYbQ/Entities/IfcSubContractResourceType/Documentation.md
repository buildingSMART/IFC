The resource type _IfcSubContractResourceType_ defines commonly shared information for occurrences of subcontract resources. The set of shared information may include:

* common productivities
* common cost rates
* common properties within shared property sets

It is used to define a subcontract resource specification (the specific resource information that is common to all occurrences of that resource). Resource types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

Occurrences of the _IfcSubContractResourceType_ are represented by instances of _IfcSubContractResource_.
