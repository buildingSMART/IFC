The entity _IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember_ defines all needed properties describing the connection between structural members and structural connection objects (nodes or supports).

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2.

**Use Definition**

_Point Connection_  
Instances of the entity _IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember_ shall be used to describe a connection between an instance of _IfcStructuralPointConnection_ and either an instance of _IfcStructuralCurveMember_ or _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_. The _RelatedStructuralConnection_ for point connections has to be of type _IfcStructuralPointConnection_.

_Curve Connection_  
Instances of the entity _IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember_ shall be used to describe a connection between an instance of _IfcStructuralCurveConnection_ and an instance of either _IfcStructuralCurveMember_ or _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_. The _RelatedStructuralConnection_ for curve connections has to be of type _IfcStructuralCurveConnection_.

_Surface Connection_  
Instances of the entity _IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember_ shall be used to describe a connection between an instance of _IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection_ and an instance of _IfcStructuralSurfaceMember_. The _RelatedStructuralConnection_ for curve connections has to be of type _IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection_.

_Coordinate System for Applied Conditions_  
All values defined by _AppliedCondition_ or _AdditionalConditions_ are given within the coordinate system provided by _ConditionCoordinateSystem_, which is defined relative to the local coordinate system of the structural member. If the _ConditionCoordinateSystem_ is not defined, the local coordinate system of the structural member is used instead.

_Supported Length_  
Optionally a supported length can be given, which specifies the length (or width) of the physical connection along a curve connection.

Figure 1 illustrates the appropriate definition of support lengths.
