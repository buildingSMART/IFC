Instances of the entity _IfcStructuralCurveConnection_ shall be used to describe 'linear nodes' or 'linear supports', i.e. lines where two or more face members (walls, plates) are joined. All values defined by _AppliedCondition_ are given within a coordinate system which is derived from the local coordinate system defined by this instance.

> <font size="-1">NOTE: This does not work for each combination of local
		  coordinate system and curve direction. Therefore such combinations shall be
		  forbidden. Normally, whenever possible, the defined local coordinate system
		  should fulfill the constraints outlined above to avoid such a transformation.
