The one-to-one relationship assigns a structural member (as instance of _IfcStructuralMember_ or its subclasses) to a physical element&nbsp; (as instance of _IfcElement_ or its subclasses) to keep the association between the design or detailing element and the structural analysis element.&nbsp;

Both, the _IfcElement_ and the _IfcStructuralMember_, may involve any number (zero, one, or many) associations between physical and analytical element. Multiple instances of _IfcRelConnectsStructuralElement_ can therefore be used to reflect the many-to-many nature of the association between physical and analytical elements.
