This enumeration type is needed for load definition and is only considered if the load values are given as global actions and if they define linear or planar loads.

The _IfcProjectedOrTrueLengthEnum_ type is referenced by the entity _IfcStructuralAction_ and its respective subclasses. It also depends on the attribute value_GlobalOrLocal_ of supertype _IfcStructuralActivity_ and should only take effect if _GlobalOrLocal_ is set to GLOBAL_COORDS.
