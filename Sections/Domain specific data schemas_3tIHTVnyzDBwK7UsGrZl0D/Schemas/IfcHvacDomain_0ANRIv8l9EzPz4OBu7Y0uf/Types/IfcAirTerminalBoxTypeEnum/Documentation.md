This enumeration identifies different types of air terminal boxes.

Valid enumerations are:

* **CONSTANTFLOW**: Terminal box does not include a means to reset the volume automatically to an outside signal such as thermostat.
* **VARIABLEFLOWPRESSUREDEPENDANT**: terminal box includes a means to reset the volume automatically to a different control point in response to an outside signal such as thermostat: air-flow rate depends on supply pressure.
* **VARIABLEFLOWPRESSUREINDEPENDANT**: terminal box includes a means to reset the volume automatically to a different control point in response to an outside signal such as thermostat: air-flow rate is independant of supply pressure.
* **USERDEFINED**: User-defined terminal box.
* **NOTDEFINED**: Undefined terminal box.
