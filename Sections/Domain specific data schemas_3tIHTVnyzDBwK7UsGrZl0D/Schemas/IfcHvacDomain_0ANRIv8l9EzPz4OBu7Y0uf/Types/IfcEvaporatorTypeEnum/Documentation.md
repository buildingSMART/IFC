Enumeration defining the typical types of evaporators. The _IfcEvaporatorTypeEnum_ contains the following:

* **DIRECTEXPANSIONSHELLANDTUBE**: Direct-expansion evaporator where a refrigerant evaporates inside a series of baffles that channel the fluid throughout the shell side.
* **DIRECTEXPANSIONTUBEINTUBE**: Direct-expansion evaporator where a refrigerant evaporates inside one or more pairs of coaxial tubes.
* **DIRECTEXPANSIONBRAZEDPLATE**: Direct-expansion evaporator where a refrigerant evaporates inside plates brazed or welded together to make up an assembly of separate channels.
* **FLOODEDSHELLANDTUBE**: Evaporator in which refrigerant evaporates outside tubes.
* **SHELLANDCOIL**: Evaporator in which refrigerant evaporates inside a simple coiled tube immersed in the fluid to be cooled.
* **USERDEFINED**: User-defined evaporator type.
* **NOTDEFINED**: Undefined evaporator type.
