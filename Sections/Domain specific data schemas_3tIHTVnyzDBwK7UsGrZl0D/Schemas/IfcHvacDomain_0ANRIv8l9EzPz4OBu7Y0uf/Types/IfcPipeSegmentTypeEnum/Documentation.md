This enumeration is used to identify the primary purpose of a pipe segment. This is a very basic categorization mechanism to generically identify the pipe segment type. Subcategories of pipe segments are not enumerated. The _IfcPipeSegmentTypeEnum_ contains the following:

* **RIGIDSEGMENT**: A rigid segment is continuous linear segment of pipe that cannot be deformed.
* **FLEXIBLESEGMENT**: A flexible segment is a continuous non-linear segment of pipe that can be deformed and change the direction of flow.
* **GUTTER**: A gutter segment is a continuous open-channel segment of pipe.
* **SPOOL**: A type of rigid segment that is typically shorter and used for providing connectivity within a piping network.
* **USERDEFINED**: User-defined segment.
* **NOTDEFINED**: Undefined segment.
