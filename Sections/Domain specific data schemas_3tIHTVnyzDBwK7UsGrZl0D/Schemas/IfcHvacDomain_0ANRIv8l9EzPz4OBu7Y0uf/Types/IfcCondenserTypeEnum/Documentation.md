Enumeration defining the typical types of condensers. Air is used as the cooling medium for AIRCOOLED; water is used as the cooling medium for all other types.

{ .spec-head}
Enumerated Item Definitions:

* **AIRCOOLED**: A condenser in which heat is transferred to an air-stream.
* **EVAPORATIVECOOLED**: A condenser that is cooled evaporatively.
* **WATERCOOLED**: Water-cooled condenser with unspecified operation.
* **WATERCOOLEDSHELLTUBE**: Water-cooled condenser with cooling water circulated through one or more tubes contained within the shell.
* **WATERCOOLEDSHELLCOIL**: Water-cooled condenser with cooling water circulated through one or more continuous or assembled coils contained within the shell.
* **WATERCOOLEDTUBEINTUBE**: Water-cooled condenser consisting of one or more assemblies of two tubes, one within the other.
* **WATERCOOLEDBRAZEDPLATE**: Water-cooled condenser with plates brazed together to form an assembly of separate channels.
* **USERDEFINED**: User-defined condenser type.
* **NOTDEFINED**: Undefined condenser type.
