The element type _IfcChillerType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a chiller and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a chiller specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A chiller type is used to define the common properties of a chiller that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A chiller is a device used to implement a refrigeration cycle for cooling a fluid, typically water or a mixture of water and glycol. The chilled water is then used to cool and dehumidify air in a building. Chiller types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcChillerType_ are represented by instances of _IfcEnergyConversionDevice_ or its subtypes.
