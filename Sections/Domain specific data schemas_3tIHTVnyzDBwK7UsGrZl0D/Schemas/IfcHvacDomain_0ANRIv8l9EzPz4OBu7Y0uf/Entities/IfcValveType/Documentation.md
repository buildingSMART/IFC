The element type _IfcValveType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a valve and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a valve specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

> <font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>) which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A valve type is used to define the common properties of a valve that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. Valves are typically is used in a building services piping distribution system to control or modulate the flow of the fluid. Valve types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcValveType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowController_ or its subtypes.
