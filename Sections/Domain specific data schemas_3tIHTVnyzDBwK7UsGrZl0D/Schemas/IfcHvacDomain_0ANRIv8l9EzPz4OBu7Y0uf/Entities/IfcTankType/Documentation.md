The element type _IfcTankType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a tank and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a tank specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

> <font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A tank type is used to define the common properties of a Tank that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A tank is a device used to hold gasses and liquids. Tank types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcTankType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowStorageDevice_ or its subtypes.
