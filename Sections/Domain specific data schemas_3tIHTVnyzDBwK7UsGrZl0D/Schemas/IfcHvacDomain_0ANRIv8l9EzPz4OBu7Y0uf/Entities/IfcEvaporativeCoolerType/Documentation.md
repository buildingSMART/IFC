The element type _IfcEvaporativeCoolerType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of an evaporative cooler and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define an evaporative cooler specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A evaporative cooler type is used to define the common properties of a evaporative cooler that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. An evaporative cooler is a device that cools air by saturating it with water vapor. Evaporative cooler types may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcEvaporativeCoolerType_ are represented by instances of _IfcEnergyConversionDevice_ or its subtypes.
