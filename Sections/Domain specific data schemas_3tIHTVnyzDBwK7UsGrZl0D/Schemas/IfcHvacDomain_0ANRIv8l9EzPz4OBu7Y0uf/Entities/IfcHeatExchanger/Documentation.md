A heat exchanger is a device used to provide heat transfer between non-mixing media such as plate and shell and tube heat exchangers.

_IfcHeatExchanger_ is commonly used on water-side distribution systems to recover energy from a liquid to another liquid (typically water-based), whereas _IfcAirToAirHeatRecovery_ is commonly used on air-side distribution systems to recover energy from a gas to a gas (usually air).
