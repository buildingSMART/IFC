> EXAMPLE&nbsp; An inch is a converted unit. It is from the Imperial system, its name is "inch" and it can be related to the SI unit, millimetre, through a measure with unit whose value is 25.4 millimetre. A foot is also a converted unit. It is from the Imperial system, its name is "foot" and it can be related to an _IfcSIUnit_, millimetre, either directly or through the unit called "inch". Note that several US customary units differ from Imperial units (nonmetric English units) of the same name.
