A defined type of simple data type REAL (required since a select type, i.e. _IfcSimpleValue_, cannot include directly simple types in its select list). In principle, the domain of _IfcReal_ (being a Real) is all rational, irrational and scientific real numbers. Here the precision is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.
