**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-41:1992**: A plane angle measure is the value of an angle in a plane.

Usually measured in radian (rad, m/m = 1), but also grads may be used. The grad unit may be declared as a conversion based unit based on radian unit.

> <font size="-1">NOTE <i>IfcPlaneAngleMeasure</i> is used where angles need to be described 
to an accuracy of less than one degree and expressed as decimal parts of an angle. It is widely 
used for angular measurement except for situations where accuracy needs to be defined using arc 
measurement; for which purpose the <i>IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure</i> is provided.
