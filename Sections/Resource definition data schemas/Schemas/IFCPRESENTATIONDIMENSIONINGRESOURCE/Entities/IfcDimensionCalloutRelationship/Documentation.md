A dimension callout relationship is a relationship between two draughting callouts. The relating draughting callout refers to a dimension (linear, diameter, radius, or angular) while the related draughting callout refers to the dimension text (as structured dimension callout). This structured dimension callout can either be denoted as "primary", in which case it presents the dimension value in the primary unit, or as "secondary", in which case it presents the dimension value in the secondary unit.
