A dimension pair relationship is a relationship between two draughting callouts. The relating draughting callout refers to a dimension (linear, diameter, radius, or angular) and the related draughting callout refers to&nbsp;another dimension (linear, diameter, radius, or angular). This structured dimension callout can either be denoted as "chained", in which case the related dimension continues from the end of the relating dimension, or as "parallel", in which case the related dimension starts again from the start of the relating dimension.
