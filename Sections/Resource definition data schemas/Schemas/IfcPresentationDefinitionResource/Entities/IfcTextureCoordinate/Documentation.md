**Definition
from IAI:** The _IfcTextureCoordinate_ a an abstract supertype of the different kinds to apply texture coordinates to geometries. For vertex based geometries an explicit assignment of 2D texture vertices to the 3D geometry vertices is supported, in addition there can be a procedural description of texture coordinates. For parametrically described base geometry types a default mapping procedure is given.
