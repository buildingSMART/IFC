An _IfcSweptSurface_ is a surface defined by sweeping a curve. The swept surface is defined by a open or closed curve, represented by a subtype if _IfcProfileDef_, that is provided as a two-dimensional curve on an implicit plane, and by the sweeping operation.

* The swept curve is defined by positioning the profile in the xy plane of the object coordinate system, 
* The sweeping operation is applied to the swept curve as defined within the subtypes of _IfcSweptSurface_;

The optional _Positio_n coordinate system allows for re-positioning the resulting swept surface relative to the object coordinate system.
