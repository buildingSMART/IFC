The _IfcLine_ is an unbounded line parameterized by an _IfcCartesianPoint_ and an _IfcVector_. The magnitude of the _IfcVector_ affects the parameterization of the line, but it does not bound the line.

> NOTE&nbsp; A line segment is defined using either the _IfcPolyline_ with two _Points_, or the _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _BasisCurve_ being an _IfcLine_.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Figure 1 illustrates an unbounded _IfcLine_ and a bounded _IfcTrimmedCurve_. A bounded line starting at 0.,0. and ending at 0.,2. can be defined by:

> 1. _IfcLine_ with _IfcVector_._Magnitude_: 2.0 AND _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _Trim1_: 0. and _Trim2_: 1. (and trimming preference being parameter);
> 2. _IfcLine_ with _IfcVector_._Magnitude_: 1.0 AND _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _Trim1_: 0. and _Trim2_: 2. (and trimming preference being parameter);
> 3. _IfcLine_ AND _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _Trim1_::_IfcCartesianPoint_ [0.,0.] and _Trim2_::_IfcCartesianPoint_ [0.,2.] (and trimming preference being Cartesian) - the _IfcVector_._Magnitude_ has no effect;
> 4. _IfcPolyline_ with _Points[1]_ being 0.,0. and _Points[2]_ being 0.,2.
> 5. _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ with two indices, pointing into a point list providing the coordinates (0.,0.) and (0.,2.).

> A line is an unbounded curve with constant tangent direction. A line is defined by a point and a direction. The positive direction of the line is in the direction of the dir vector. The curve is parameterized as follows: 
>> **P** = Pnt  
>> **V** = Dir  
>> &lambda;(_u_) = **P** + _u_**V**
>  and the parametric range is: -&infin; &lt; _u_ &lt; &infin;
