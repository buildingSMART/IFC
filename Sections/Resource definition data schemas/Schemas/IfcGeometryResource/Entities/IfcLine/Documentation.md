**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: A line is an unbounded curve with constant tangent direction. A line is defined by a point and a direction. The positive direction of the line is in the direction of the Dir vector. The line is parameterized as follows:

> **P** = Pnt   
> **V** = Dir   
> <font face="Symbol">l</font>(_u_) = **P** + _u_**V**
>

and the parametric range is <font face="Symbol">-&yen;</font> &lt; _u_ &lt; <font face="Symbol">&yen;</font>
