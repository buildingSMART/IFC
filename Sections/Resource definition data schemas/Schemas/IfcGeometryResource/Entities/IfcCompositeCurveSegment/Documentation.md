**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: A composite curve segment (IfcCompositeCurveSegment) is a bounded curve together with transition information which is used to construct a composite curve (IfcCompositeCurve).

The derived attribute Dim has been added (see also note at IfcGeometricRepresentationItem). The IfcCompositeCurveSegment is a subtype of IfcGeometricRepresentationItem (whereas in STEP P42 composite_curve_segment is not a subtype of geometric_representation_item, the proposed 2nd edition of P42 however proposes the subtype relationship).
