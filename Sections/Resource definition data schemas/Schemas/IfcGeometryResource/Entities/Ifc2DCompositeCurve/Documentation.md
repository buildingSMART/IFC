An _Ifc2DCompositeCurve_ is an _IfcCompositeCurve_ that is defined within the coordinate space of an _IfcPlane_. Therefore the dimensionality of the _Ifc2DCompositeCurve_ has to be 2.

> <font size="-1" color="#FF0000">NOTE OF DEPRECATION: After the
		  enhancement of the profile definition capacities in IFC Release 2.x this entity
		  is not needed anymore for the definition of boundaries on a plane. Therefore
		  this entity is marked as deprecated - that means it will not be supported in
		  future versions of IFC.</font>

> <font color="#0000FF" size="-1">NOTE: This entity has been introduced
		  to get a more straight forward definition of surface boundaries than by its
		  counterpart in STEP: composite_curve_on_surface and boundary_curve. Since the
		  only basis elementary surface in IFC is the plane surface, a two dimensional
		  composite curve provides enough capability to define the boundary. </font>
