An _IfcCircle_ is a curve consisting of a set of points having equal distance from the center.

> NOTE&nbsp; A circular arc segment is defined by using the _IfcTrimmedCurve_ with _BasisCurve_ being an _IfcCircle_.

Figure 1 illustrates the definition of _IfcCircle_ within a three-dimensional position coordinate system placed within the object coordinate system of an element.
