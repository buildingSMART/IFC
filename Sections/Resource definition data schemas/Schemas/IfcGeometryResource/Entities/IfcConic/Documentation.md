**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: A conic (IfcConic) is a planar curve which could be produced by intersecting a plane with a cone. A conic is defined in terms of its intrinsic geometric properties rather than being described in terms of other geometry. A conic class always has a placement coordinate system defined by a two or three dimensional placement. The parametric representation is defined in terms of this placement coordinate system.

		  have been incorporated into IFC 1.0, 1.5 &amp; 2.0: circle as IfcCircle,
		  ellipse as IfcEllipse. The derived attribute Dim has been added at this level
		  and was therefore demoted from the geometric_representation_item. Please refer
		  to ISO/IS 10303-42:1994, p. 38 for the final definition of the formal standard.
