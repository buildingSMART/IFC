An IfcDistanceExpression describes a point relative to a basis curve according to distance along the basis curve in 3D or as projected onto the horizontal plane, offset lateral to the basis curve according to the horizontal orientation at the specified distance, offset vertical to the basis curve, and an optional additional offset parallel to the basis curve that may be used to address locations otherwise unreachable where the basis curve is tangentially discontinuous.
