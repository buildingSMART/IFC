The abstract definition of a bounded 2D curve representation item. Each curve segment is defined by a start point, a start direction, a segment length and additional curve geometry parameter. It defines arcs without the need to use a trimmed curve.

> NOTE&nbsp; Such 2D curves are used in particular by horizontal alignment segments.
