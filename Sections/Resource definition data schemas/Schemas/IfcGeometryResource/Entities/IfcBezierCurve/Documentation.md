**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: This is a special type of curve which can be represented as a type of B-spline curve in which the knots are evenly spaced and have high multiplicities. Suitable default values for the knots and knot multiplicities are derived in this case.

A B-spline curve is _a piecewise Bezier_ curve if it is quasi-uniform except that the interior knots have multiplicity _degree_ rather than having multiplicity one. In this subtype the knot spacing is 1.0, starting at 0.0. A _piecewise Bezier_ curve which has only two knots, 0.0 and 1.0, each of multiplicity (degree+1), is a simple Bezier curve.
