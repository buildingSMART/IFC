The _IfcTransitionCurveType_ indicates the curvature of a transition curve.

Resulting cartesian coordinates (relative to starting position and orientation) are given by equations herein, where _l_ (lowercase) refers to the distance along the curve segment, L refers to the length of the curve segment (_IfcCurveSegment2D_._Length_), and R refers to the radius at the circular end of the curve segment (e.g. _IfcTransitionCurveSegment2D_._EndRadius_).
