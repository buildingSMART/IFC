{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> This type indicates that the B-spline knots shall have a particularly simple form enabling the knots themselves to be defaulted.

> NOTE&nbsp; Type adapted from **knot_type** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New type in IFC4.
