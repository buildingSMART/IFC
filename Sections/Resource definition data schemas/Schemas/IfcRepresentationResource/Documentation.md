_Definition of the IAI_: This schema defines the representation of shape and topology as important definitional properties for products defined within the IFC Object Model. The representations characterize certain properties of a product, and any product can be defined by zero, one, or many of those properties. The schema defines two ways to represent definitional properties of products:

* topological representation 
*  geometric shape representation 

The geometric shape representation allows for

* multiple shape representations for the same product definition shape of a product 
* separate shape representations for components or parts of the product definition shape by using shape aspects 

The following parts of ISO10303, STEP, had been reviewed to provide input into the specification of the representation resource for the IFC Object Model:

* _Part 41_, Integrated Generic Resources &#150; Fundamental of Product Description and Support product_property_definition_schema product_property_representation_schema 
* _Part 42_, Integrated Generic Resources &#150; Geometric and Topological Representation geometry_schema 
* _Part 43_, Integrated Generic Resources &#150; Representation Structures representation_schema 

Please note, that the above listed resources which are defined within Integrated Resources of STEP had been interpreted to fit into the IFC architecture.
