The _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ defines the context that applies to several shape representations of products within a project. It defines the type of the context in which the shape representation is defined, and the numeric precision applicable to the geometric representation items defined in this context. In addition it can be used to offset the project coordinate system from a global point of origin, using the _WorldCoordinateSystem_ attribute. The main representation context may also provide the true north direction, see Figure 1.

    The <em>TrueNorth</em> attribute should be provided, if the y axis of the <em>WorldCoordinateSystem</em> does not point to the global northing. Direction of the true north, or geographic northing direction, relative to the underlying project coordinate system as established by the attribute <em>WorldCoordinateSystem</em>. It is given by a 2 dimensional direction within the xy-plane of the project coordinate system. If not resent, it defaults to [0.,1.] - i.e. the positive Y axis of the project coordinate system equals the geographic northing direction. The direction is provided within project coordinate system and identifies the true north direction.</p>

The use of one instance of _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ to represent the model (3D) view is mandatory, the use of a second instance of _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ to represent the plan (2D) view is optional (but needs to be given, if there are scale dependent plan views), the additional scale or view dependent contexts need to be handled by using the subtype _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ pointing to the model view (or the plan view) as the _ParentContext_. See Figure 2 for an example using geometric representation contexts for 3D and 2D with assigned sub contexts.

> NOTE&nbsp; The inherited attribute _ContextType_ shall have one of the following recognized values: 'Model', 'Plan', 'NotDefined'.
