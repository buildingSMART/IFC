The _IfcRepresentation_ defines the general concept of representing product properties and in particular the product shape.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition from ISO 10303-43:  
> A representation is a collection of one or more representation items that are related in a specified representation context. The relationship of representation item to representation context is the basis for distinguishing which representation item entities are related.  
>   
> A representation item can be related to a representation context directly, when it occurs as an element is a representation, or indirectly, when it is referenced through any number of intervening entities, each of type representation item.

> NOTE&nbsp; Entity adapted from **representation** defined in ISO 10303-42.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2.0

{ .change-ifc2x3}
> IFC2x3 CHANGE&nbsp; The inverse attributes _LayerAssignments_ and_RepresentationMap_ have been added with upward compatibility.

> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Entity _IfcRepresentation_ has been changed into an ABSTRACT supertype.

Representation Use Definition

Each representation, either _IfcShapeRepresentation_, or _IfcTopologyRepresentation_ shall have a well defined:

*  _ContextOfItems_: Reference to an _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_ as agreed for this representation. 
*  _RepresentationIdentifier_: Name of the representation, for example, 'Body' for 3D shape, 'FootPrint' for 2D ground view, 'Axis' for reference axis. 
*  _RepresentationType_: Name for the geometric, or topological representation type, for example, 'SweptSolid' for 3D swept solids, 'Brep' for boundary representation. 

> NOTE&nbsp; Guidelines for applying correct values to those attributes are provided in the geometry use definition section at each subtype of _IfcElement_. These guidelines can be further refined in view definitions or implementer agreements.
