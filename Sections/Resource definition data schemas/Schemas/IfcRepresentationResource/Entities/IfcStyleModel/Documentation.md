The _IfcStyleModel_ represents the concept of a particular&nbsp;presentation style defined for a material (or other characteristic) of a product or a product component within a representation context. This representation context may (but has not to be) a geometric representation context.&nbsp;


The _IfcStyleModel_ can be a style representation
(presentation style) of a material (via _IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_),
potentially differentiated for different representation contexts (e.g.
different material hatching depending on the scale of the target
representation context).
