_IfcProductRepresentation_ defines a representation of a product, including its (geometric or topological) representation. A product can have zero, one or many geometric representations, and a single geometric representation can be shared among various products using mapped representations.

> NOTE&nbsp; The definition of this entity relates to the ISO 10303 entity property_definition. The use of the term &lsquo;property&rsquo; was avoided since it conflicts with the property, property type, and property set definitions elsewhere in the IFC model.
