_IfcShapeAspect_ allows for grouping of shape representation items that represent aspects (or components) of the shape of a product. Thereby shape representations of components of the product shape represent a distinctive part to a product that can be explicitly addressed.

The _IfcShapeAspect_'s may have distinct material information or other distict characteristics that differs from other parts of the product shape representation.

> NOTE&nbsp; The _IfcShapeAspect_ together with the _IfcMaterialConstituent_ can be used to associate distict material information to parts of the product shape representation.

Figure 1 indicates the association of material characteristics to shape aspects.

Informal Propositions:

1. If _ShapeRepresentations_ points to shape representations that are part of an _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, _PartOfProductDefinitionShape_ must refer to this instance of _IfcProductDefinitionShape_.
2. If _ShapeRepresentations_ points to shape representations that are part of an _IfcRepresentationMap_, _PartOfProductDefinitionShape_ must refer to this instance of _IfcRepresentationMap_.
