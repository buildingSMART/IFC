_IfcCShapeProfileDef_ defines a section profile that provides the defining parameters of a C-shaped section to be used by the swept area solid. This section is typically produced by cold forming steel. Its parameters and orientation relative to the position coordinate system are according to the following illustration. The centre of the position coordinate system is in the profile's centre of the bounding box.

{ .change-ifc2x3}
> IFC2x3 CHANGE&nbsp; All profile origins are now in the center of the bounding box.

{ .change-ifc4}
> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Type of _InternalFilletRadius_ relaxed to allow for zero radius. Trailing attribute _CentreOfGravityInX_ deleted, use respective property in _IfcExtendedProfileProperties_ instead.

Figure 1 illustrates parameters of the C-shape profile definition. The parameterized profile defines its own position coordinate system. The underlying coordinate system is defined by the swept area solid that uses the profile definition. It is the xy plane of:

* _IfcSweptAreaSolid.Position_

By using offsets of the position location, the parameterized profile can be positioned centric (using x,y offsets = 0.), or at any position relative to the profile. The parameterized profile is defined by a set of parameter attributes. In the illustrated example, the 'CentreOfGravityInX' property in _IfcExtendedProfileProperties_, if provided, is negative.
