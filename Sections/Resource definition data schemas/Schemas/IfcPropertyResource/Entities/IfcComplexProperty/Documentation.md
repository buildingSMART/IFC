This _IfcComplexProperty_ is used to define complex properties to be handled completely within a property set. The included list may be a mixed or consistent collection of _IfcProperty_ subtypes. This enables the definition of a list of properties to be included as a single 'property' entry in a property set. The definition of such a list can be reused in many different property sets, but the instantiation of such a complex property shall only be used within a single property set.
