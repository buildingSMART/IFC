The _IfcPropertyReferenceValue_ allows a property value to be given by referencing other entities within the resource definitions of IFC. Those other entities are regarded as predefined complex properties and can be aggregated within a property set (_IfcPropertySet_). The allowable entities to be used as value references are given by the _IfcObjectReferenceSelect_.
