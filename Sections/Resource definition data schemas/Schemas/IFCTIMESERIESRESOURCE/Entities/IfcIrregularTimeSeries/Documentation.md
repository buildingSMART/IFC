> <font size="-1">EXAMPLES: A circulating pump cycles on and off at unpredictable times
        as dictated by the demands on the piping system; the amount of light in i.e., a classroom
        varies depending on when the lights are manually switched on and off and and how many
        lamps are controlled by each switch; etc.
