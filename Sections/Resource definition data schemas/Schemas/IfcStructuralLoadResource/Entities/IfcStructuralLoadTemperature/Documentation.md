An instance of the entity _IfcStructuralLoadTemperature_ shall be used to define actions which are caused by a temperature change. The change of temperature is given with a constant value which is applied to the complete section and values for the outer fibre of the positive Y and Z directions.

All values are given within the chosen coordinate system of the 'activity element' (subtypes of _IfcStructuralActivity_), either the local coordinate system of the activity element or the global project coordinate system which is referenced by the activity element as its geometric representation context. The unit of the temperature values are given within the global unit assignment (_IfcUnitAssignment_).
