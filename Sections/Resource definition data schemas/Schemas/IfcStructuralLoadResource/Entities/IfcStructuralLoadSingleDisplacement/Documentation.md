Instances of the entity _IfcStructuralLoadSingleDisplacement_ shall be used to define the displacements of an action operating on a single point.

All values are given within the chosen coordinate system of the 'activity element' (subtypes of _IfcStructuralActivity_), either the local coordinate system of the activity element or the global project coordinate system which is referenced by the activity element as its geometric representation context. The units of the displacement and rotation values are given within the global unit assignment (_IfcUnitAssignment_).
