Instances of the entity _IfcStructuralLoadSingleForceWarping_, as a subtype of _IfcStructuralLoadSingleForce_, shall be used to define an action operation on a single point. In addition to forces and moments defined by its supertype a warping moment can be defined.

All values are given within the chosen coordinate system of the 'activity element' (subtypes of _IfcStructuralActivity_), either the local coordinate system of the activity element or the global project coordinate system which is referenced by the activity element as its geometric representation context. The units of the displacement and rotation values are given within the global unit assignment (_IfcUnitAssignment_).
