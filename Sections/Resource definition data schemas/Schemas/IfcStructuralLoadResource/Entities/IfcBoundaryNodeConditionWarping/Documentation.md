_IfcBoundaryNodeConditionWarping_ inherits all attributes from _IfcBoundaryNodeCondition_ and includes additionally the possibility to define a value describing the warping stiffness.

If a warping stiffness value is needed, an instance of this entity must be used. Otherwise, an instance of _IfcBoundaryNodeCondition_ is adequate.

> <font size="-1">NOTE: Instances of the entity
		<i>IfcBoundaryNodeConditionWarping</i> are used e.g., to define the boundary
		condition for instances of <i>IfcStructuralPointConnection</i> or
		<i>IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember</i> pointing to a structural node connection.
