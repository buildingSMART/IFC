Instances of the entity _IfcStructuralLoadSingleForce_ shall be used to define the forces and moments of an action operating on a single point.

All values are given within the chosen coordinate system of the 'activity element' (subtypes of _IfcStructuralActivity_), either the local coordinate system of the activity element or the global project coordinate system which is referenced by the activity element as its geometric representation context. The units of the force and moment values are given within the global unit assignment (_IfcUnitAssignment_).
