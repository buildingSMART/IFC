The _IfcStructuralLoadResource_ holds the definitions of structural loads, boundary conditions, and connection conditions. These definitions specify the force, moment, stiffness, displacement and other factor, independently of the location, where such loads take effect.

The load resource definitions are used in other parts of the IFC model, including by the definition of structural actions and reactions that places the load definitions into 2D or 3D space.
