**Enumeration**

<table> 
		<tr> 
		  <td><i>Value</i></td> 
		  <td><i>Definition</i></td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr>
		  <td>BLINN</td>
		  <td>A reflectance model providing a smooth, slightly shiny
			 appearance.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr> 
		  <td>FLAT</td> 
		  <td>A reflectance model providing a constant colour. This model ignores
			 the effect of all light sources.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>GLASS</td> 
		  <td>A reflectance model that supports an approximation of glass-like
			 materials that have both reflective and transmissive properties.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>MATT</td> 
		  <td>A reflectance model providing a dull matte appearance.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>METAL</td> 
		  <td>A reflectance model providing a specular metallic appearance.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>MIRROR</td> 
		  <td>A reflectance model that supports secondary mirrored views through
			 ray tracing.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>PHONG</td> 
		  <td>A reflectance model conforming with the Phong model in which
			 reflections are greatest in the `mirror' direction of a surface opposite the
			 viewing direction with respect to the surface normal.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>PLASTIC</td> 
		  <td>A reflectance model providing a specular effect which is similar to
			 the Phong model.</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr>
		  <td>STRAUSS</td>
		  <td>A reflectance model for metallic and non-metallic appearance based
			 on a limited set of control parameter.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr> 
		  <td>NOTDEFINED</td> 
		  <td>&nbsp;</td>
