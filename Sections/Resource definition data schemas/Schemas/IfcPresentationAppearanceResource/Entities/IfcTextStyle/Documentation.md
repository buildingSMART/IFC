The _IfcTextStyle_ is a presentation style for annotations that place a text in model space. The _IfcTextStyle_ provides the text style for presentation information assigned to _IfcTextLiteral_'s. The style is defined by color, text font characteristics, and text box characteristics.

An _IfcTextStyle_ is instantiated with:

* _TextCharacterAppearance_: _IfcTextStyleForDefinedFont_
* _TextStyle_: _IfcTextStyleTextModel_
* _TextFontStyle_: _IfcTextStyleFontModel_

An _IfcTextStyle_ is assigned to _IfcTextLiteral_ through the _IfcStyledItem_ entity.
