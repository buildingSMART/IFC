**Definition
from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992**: The fill area style hatching defines a styled pattern of curves for hatching an annotation fill area or a surface.

**Definition
from IAI**: The _IfcFillAreaStyleHatching_ is used to define simple, vector-based hatching patterns, based on styled straight lines. The curve font, color and thickness is given by the _HatchLineAppearance_, the angle by the _HatchLineAngle_ and the distance to the next hatch line by _StartOfNextHatchLine_, being either an offset distance or a vector.

> <small>NOTE&nbsp;
If the hatch pattern involves two (potentially
crossing) rows of hatch lines, then two instances of <i>IfcFillAreaStyleHatching</i>
should be assigned to the <i>IfcFillAreaStyle</i>.
Both share the same
(virtual) point of origin of the hatching that is used by the reference
hatch line (or the <i>PointOfReferenceHatchLine</i>
if there is an
offset).</small>
> 


For better control of the hatching appearance, when using hatch lines with other fonts then continuous, the _PatternStart_ allows to offset the start of the curve font pattern along the reference hatch line (if not given, the _PatternStart_ is at zero distance from the virtual point of origin). If the reference hatch line does not go through the origin (of the virtual hatching coordinate system), it can be offset by using the&nbsp;_PatternStart&nbsp;_~~_PointOfReferenceHatchLine_.~~

> <small>NOTE&nbsp;
The coordinates of the <i>PatternStart </i><strike>and
the </strike><i><strike>PointOfReferenceHatchLine</strike>
</i>are
given relative to the assumed
0., 0. virtual point of origin at which the hatch pattern is later
positioned by the <i>FillStyleTarget</i>
point at <i>IfcAnnotationFillAreaOccurrence</i>.&nbsp;
The measure values are given in global drawing length units and apply
to the target plot scale for the scale depended representation
subcontext.</small>
