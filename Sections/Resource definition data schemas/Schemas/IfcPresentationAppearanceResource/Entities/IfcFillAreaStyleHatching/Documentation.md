The _IfcFillAreaStyleHatching_ is used to define simple, vector-based hatching patterns, based on styled straight lines. The curve font, color and thickness is given by the _HatchLineAppearance_, the angle by the _HatchLineAngle_ and the distance to the next hatch line by _StartOfNextHatchLine_, being either an offset distance or a vector.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 10303-46:  
> The fill area style hatching defines a styled pattern of curves for hatching an annotation fill area or a surface.

> NOTE&nbsp; If the hatch pattern involves two (potentially crossing) rows of hatch lines, then two instances of _IfcFillAreaStyleHatching_ should be assigned to the _IfcFillAreaStyle_. Both share the same (virtual) point of origin of the hatching that is used by the reference hatch line (or the _PointOfReferenceHatchLine_ if there is an offset).

For better control of the hatching appearance, when using hatch lines with other fonts then continuous, the _PatternStart_ allows to offset the start of the curve font pattern along the reference hatch line (if not given, the _PatternStart_ is at zero distance from the virtual point of origin). If the reference hatch line does not go through the origin (of the virtual hatching coordinate system), it can be offset by using the _PatternStart_ .

> NOTE&nbsp; The coordinates of the _PatternStart_ are given relative to the origin of the object coordinate of _IfcAnnotationFillArea_, or if present, the _FillAreaTarget_ attribute of _IfcAnnotationFillArea_. The measure values are given in global drawing length units, representing a model hatching, and can be translated into drawing units by the _TargetScale_ for a scale depended _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubcontext_, if provided.

{ .deprecated}
> DEPRECATION&nbsp; The use of _PointOfReferenceHatchLine_ is deprecated.

> NOTE&nbsp; Entity adapted from **fill_area_style_hatching** defined in ISO10303-46

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x3}
> IFC2x3 CHANGE&nbsp; The _IfcFillAreaStyleHatching_ has been changed by making the attributes _PatternStart_ and _PointOfReferenceHatchLine_ OPTIONAL. The attribute _StartOfNextHatchLine_ has changed to a SELECT with the additional choice of _IfcPositiveLengthMeasure_. Upward compatibility for file based exchange is guaranteed.

{ .change-ifc4}
> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The attribute data type for _StartOfNextHatchLine_ has been changed to be a select of _IfcPositiveLengthMeasure_ and _IfcVector_.
