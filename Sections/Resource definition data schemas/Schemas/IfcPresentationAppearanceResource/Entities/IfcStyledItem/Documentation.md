The _IfcStyledItem_ holds presentation style information for products, either explicitly for an _IfcGeometricRepresentationItem_ being part of an _IfcShapeRepresentation_ assigned to a product, or by assigning presentation information to _IfcMaterial_ being assigned as other representation for a product.

* If the _IfcStyledItem_ is used within a reference from an _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ then one _Item_ shall be provided.
* If the _IfcStyledItem_ is used within a reference from an _IfcMaterialDefinitionRepresentation_ then no _Item_ shall be provided.

Figure 1 illustrates use of _IfcStyledItem_ for the two usage examples:

* <small>As a presentation for a geometric representation item</small>
* <small>As a presentation for a material definition</small>

> NOTE&nbsp; The new _IfcStyleAssignmentSelect_ allows the direct assignment styles, such as _IfcCurveStyle_, _IfcSurfaceStyle_ without using the intermediate _IfcPresentationStyleAssignment_
