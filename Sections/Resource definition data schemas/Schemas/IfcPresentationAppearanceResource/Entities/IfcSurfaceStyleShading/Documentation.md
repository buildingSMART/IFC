**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992**: The surface style rendering allows the realistic visualization of surfaces referring to rendering techniques based on the laws of physics and mathematics.

The entity _IfcSurfaceStyleShading_ allows for colour information used for shading, whereas subtypes provide data for more sophisticated rendering techniques. The surface colour is used for colouring or simple shading of the assigned surfaces.

		  definition of the formal standard. No rendering method is defined for each
		  surface style (such as constant, colour, dot or normal shading), therefore the
		  attribute rendering_method has been omitted.</font>
