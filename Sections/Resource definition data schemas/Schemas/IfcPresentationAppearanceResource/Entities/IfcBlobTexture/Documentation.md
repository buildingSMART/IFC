An _IfcBlobTexture_ provides a 2-dimensional distribution of the lighting parameters of a surface onto which it is mapped. The texture itself is given as a single binary, representing the content of a pixel format. The file format of the pixel file is given by the _RasterFormat_ attribute and allowable formats&nbsp;are guided by where rule WR41.

> <small>NOTE &nbsp;Toolbox specific implementations
of the binary datatype may restrict the maximum length of the binary to
capture the binary file content.</small>
> 


For interpretation of the texture nodes see _IfcImageTexture_ definition.
