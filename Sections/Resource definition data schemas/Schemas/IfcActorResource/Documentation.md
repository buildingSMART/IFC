The _IfcActorResource_ schema within the IFC model enables representation of information concerning a person or an organization that will undertake work, hold responsibility, etc. _IfcActorResource_ schema is developed as a separate resource schema containing identified actor related classes because it is a general idea that can be related to many other classes.   
  
The classes and attributes within the _IfcActorResource_ schema supports the identification of properties of persons and organizations whose services may be used. Additionally it supports relating persons to organizations, and relationships between organizations, e.g. to form hierarchical organization structures. The scope of the schema is to be sufficient for the purposes of a model dealing with project design and construction and for management of the constructed facility (within the scope of business processes supported by this release of the IFC model) following project completion. The information content of the schema is not sufficient for the exchange of detailed information about human resources.  
  
The _IfcActorResource_ schema is defined following an adaptation of person_organization schema contained in the ISO/CD 10303-41:1992, Industrial Automation Systems and Integration: Product Data Representation and Exchange Part 41: Integrated generic resources: Fundamentals of product description and support. For more information on the definitions as defined in the formal ISO standard please refer to: ISO/IS 10303-41:1994. The formal standard can be obtained through the local publishers of standards in each individual country.  
  
Amendments and extensions to the schema have been defined to meet the requirements of IAI defined business processes in AEC/FM design, construction and facilities management operations.
