> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> An oriented edge is an edge constructed from another edge and contains a BOOLEAN direction flag to indicate whether or not the orientation of the constructed edge agrees with the orientation of the original edge. Except for perhaps orientation, the oriented edge is equivalent to the original edge.   
>   
> A common practice is solid modelling systems is to have an entity that represents the "use" or "traversal" of an edge. This "use" entity explicitly represents the requirement in a manifold solid that each edge must be traversed exactly twice, once in each direction. The "use" functionality is provided by the edge subtype oriented edge.
