_IfcMaterialLayer_ is a single and identifiable part of an element which is constructed of a number of layers (one or more). Each _IfcMaterialLayer_ has a constant thickness and is located relative to the referencing _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ along the material layer set base (MlsBase).

Air gaps within a material layer set are represented as an _IfcMaterialLayer_ with the attribute _IsVentilated_ having the value TRUE or UNKNOWN. Such air gaps shall be interpreted as voids (not having a material).

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; A cavity wall with brick masonry used with an air gap in between would be modeled using three _IfcMaterialLayer_'s: [1] Brick, [2] Air gap, [3] Brick. The inner layer "Brick" would have a _Name_ = "Brick", an individual _LayerThickness_, and potentially a _Category_ indicating it as "load bearing", and a _Priority_ that controls how this material layer interacts with other material layers in wall connections.

The _IfcMaterialLayer_ may have a material layer name which may differ from the _IfcMaterial_ name referenced.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; The _IfcMaterialLayer_ name of an insulation layer can be "Insulation", whereas the _IfcMaterial_ name is "polystyrene insulating boards".

> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The attributes _Name_, _Description_, _Category_, _Priority_ have been added at the end of attribute list. Data type of _LayerThickness_ relaxed to _IfcNonNegativeLengthMeasure_.
