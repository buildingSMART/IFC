_IfcDocumentInformation_ captures "metadata" of an external document. The actual content of the document is not defined in this specification; instead, it can be found following the _Location_ attribute.

The same _IfcDocumentInformation_ can be referenced from the exchange structure in total or in parts (e.g. by refering to particular chapters or paragraphs) using the _IfcDocumentReference_. All _IfcDocumentReference_'s that utilize the _IfcDocumentInformation_ are accessible by the inverse relationship _HasDocumentReferences_.
