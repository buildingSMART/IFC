An _IfcLibraryReference_ is a reference into a library of information by location (as an URL). It also provides an optional inherited _ItemReference_ key to allow more specific references to library sections or tables, and the inherited _Name_ attribute allows for a human interpretable identification of the library item. Also, general information on the external library can be given through _IfcLibraryInformation_, accessed by ReferenceIntoLibrary.
