### Use Definitions
 The term 'classification item' is used in
	 preference to the term 'table' for improved flexibility. For example, the
	 classification item "L681" in Uniclass may be used to contain all subsequent
	 notation facets within that class of classifications which has the title
	 "Proofings, insulation" (e.g. L6811, L6812, L6813 etc.).
