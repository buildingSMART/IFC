**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992**: The light source directional is a subtype of light source. This entity has a light source direction. With a conceptual origin at infinity, all the rays of the light are parallel to this direction. This kind of light source lights a surface based on the surface's orientation, but not position.

**Definition from ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997**: The directional light node defines a directional light source that illuminates along rays parallel to a given 3-dimensional vector. Directional light nodes do not attenuate with distance. Directional light nodes are specified in the local coordinate system and are affected by ancestor transformations.
