There are three kinds of light distribution curves:

1. Type A Photometry
2. Type B Photometry 
3. Type C Photometry.

The following applies (Definitions according to Standard CEN TC 169, prEN 13032-1, CIE 121 ):

1. Type A is basically not used. For completeness the Type A Photometry equals the Type B rotated 90&deg; around the Z-Axis counter clockwise.
2. Type B is sometimes used for floodlights. The B-Plane System has a horizontal axis. B-Angles are valid from -180&deg; to +180&deg; with B 0&deg; at the bottom and B180&deg;/B-180&deg; at the top, &#946;-Angles are valid from -90&deg; to +90&deg;. (See the pictures below.)
3. Type C is the recommended standard system. The C-Plane system equals a globe with a vertical axis. C-Angles are valid from 0&deg; to 360&deg;, &#947;-Angles are valid from 0&deg; (south pole) to 180&deg; (north pole). (See the pictures below.)
