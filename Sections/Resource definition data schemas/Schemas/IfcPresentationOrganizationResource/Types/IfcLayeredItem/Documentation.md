**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-46:1992**: The layered things type selects those things, which can be grouped in layers.

It is the collection of all those items, that are assigned to a single layer. These items are representation items or complete representations (_IfcRepresentationItem, IfcRepresentation_). If an _IfcRepresentation_ is referenced, all _IfcRepresentationItem_ within its set of _Items_ are assigned to the same layer.
