An _IfcMetric_ is used to capture quantitative resultant metrics that can be applied to objectives.

_IfcMetric_ is a subtype of _IfcConstraint_ and may be associated with any subtype of _IfcRoot_ through the _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_ relationship in the _IfcControlExtension_ schema, or may be associated with _IfcProperty_ by _IfcResourceConstraintRelationship_.

The aim of _IfcMetric_ is to capture the quantitative aspects of a constraint.
