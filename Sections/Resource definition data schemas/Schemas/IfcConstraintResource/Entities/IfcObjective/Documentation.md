An _IfcObjective_ captures qualitative information for an objective-based constraint.

_IfcObjective_ is a subtype of _IfcConstraint_ and may be associated with any subtype of _IfcRoot_ through the _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_ relationship in the _IfcControlExtension_ schema, or may be associated with _IfcProperty_ by _IfcResourceConstraintRelationship_.

The aim of _IfcObjective_ is to specify the purpose for which the constraint is applied and to capture the benchmark metrics of the constraint.
