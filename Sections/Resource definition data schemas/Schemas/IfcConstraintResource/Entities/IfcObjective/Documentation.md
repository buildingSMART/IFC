### Use Definition
_IfcObjective_ is a subtype of _IfcConstraint_ and may be associated with any subtype of IfcObject through the _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_ relationship in the _IfcControlExtension_ schema.

The aim of _IfcObjective_ is to specify the purpose for which the constraint is applied and to capture the values of the constraint. These may be both the benchmark values that are intended to indicate the constraint extent and the resulting values in use that enable performance comparisons to be applied.
