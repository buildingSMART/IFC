This is a collection of mechanical properties related to steel (or other metallic and isotropic) materials.

**NOTE:** In certain dimensioning calculations a secant modulus is used instead of the Young&acute;s modulus. Essentially, this is the same measure, but with a slightly different physical meaning. In such cases, i. e. when a secant modulus is needed, the value of the inherited attribute YoungModulus should be applied.
