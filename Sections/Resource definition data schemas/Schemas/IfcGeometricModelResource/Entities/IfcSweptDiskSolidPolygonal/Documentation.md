The _IfcSweptDiskSolidPolygonal_ is a _IfcSweptDiskSolid_ where the _Directrix_ is restricted to be provided by an poly line only. An optional _FilletRadius_ attribute can be asserted, it is then applied as a fillet to all transitions between the segments of the poly line.

> NOTE&nbsp; The geometric item _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ provides a more compact representation compared with _IfcPolyline_. Therefore it is the prefered curve representation for the _Directrix_. The _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ shall not have _Segments_ defined, resticting it to a poly line only.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC4.

Informal Propositions:

1. The _FilletRadius_, if provided, has to be smaller then or equal to the length of the start and end segment of the _IfcPolyline_, and smaller then or equal to one half of the length of the shortest inner segment.
