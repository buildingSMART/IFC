The _IfcBlock_ is a Construction Solid Geometry (CSG) 3D primitive. It is defined by a position and a positve distance along the three orthogonal axes. The inherited _Position_ attribute has the _IfcAxisPlacement3D_ type and provides:

* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position_: The location and orientation of the axis system for the primitive.
* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Location_: The block has one vertex at location and the edges are aligned with the placement axes in the positive sense.

The _XLength_, _YLength_, and _ZLength_ attributes define the size of the IfcBlock along the three axes.

Texture definition

On each side face, textures are aligned facing upright. On the top and bottom faces, textures are aligned facing front-to-back. Textures are stretched or repeated to the extent of each face according to _RepeatS_ and _RepeatT_.

Figure 2 illustrates default texture mapping with a clamped texture (RepeatS=False and RepeatT=False). The image on the left shows the texture where the S axis points to the right and the T axis points up. The image on the right shows the texture applied to the geometry where the X axis points back to the right, the Y axis points back to the left, and the Z axis points up.
