A clipping result is defined as a special subtype of the general Boolean result (_IfcBooleanResult_). It constrains the operands and the operator of the Boolean result.

A clipping result is the Boolean difference between a solid (restricted to swept area solid) and a half space solid, whereas more than one difference operation can be applied to the Boolean result.
