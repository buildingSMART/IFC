**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: A faceted brep is a simple form of boundary representation model in which all faces are planar and all edges are straight lines. Unlike the B-rep model, edges and vertices are not represented explicitly in the model but are implicitly available through the poly loop entity. A faceted B-rep has to meet the same topological constraints as the manifold solid Brep.

		B-rep with voids is represented by an own subtype and not defined via an
		implicit ANDOR supertype constraint as in ISO/IS 10303-42:1994. This change has
		been made due to the fact, that only ONEOF supertype constraint is allowed
		within the IFC object model. </font><font color="#0000FF" size="-1">HISTORY New class in IFC Release 1.0

**Informal proposition:**

1. All the bounding loops of all the faces of all the shells in the _IfcFacetedBrep_ shall be of type _IfcPolyLoop_.
