**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992:** The swept area solid entity collects the entities which are defined procedurally by sweeping action on planar bounded surfaces. The position is space of the swept solid will be dependent upon the position of the swept area. The swept area will be a face of the resulting swept area solid, except for the case of a revolved area solid with angle equal to 2<font face="Symbol"> p</font> (or 360 degrees).

The swept area is defined by a cross section (also referred to as profile), which is given as a closed two-dimensional boundary on an implicit plane. The swept area is defined in the xy plane of the position coordinate system, which is given for the swept area solid.
