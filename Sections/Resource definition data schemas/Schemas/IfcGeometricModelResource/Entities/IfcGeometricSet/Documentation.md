**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: This entity is intended for the transfer of models when a topological structure is not available.

The _IfcGeometricSet_ is used for the exchange of shape representations consisting of (2D or 3D) points, curves, and/or surfaces, which do not have a topological structure (such as connected face sets or shells) and are not solid models (such as swept solids, CSG or Brep)
