**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: This type identifies the types of entity which may be selected as the root of a CSG tree including a single CSG primitive as a special case (currently not in IFC).

In the current IFC Release only Boolean result (_IfcBooleanResult_) is defined for being a root tree expression (at _IfcCsgSolid_). CSG primitives are out of scope for the current IFC Release.
