_IfcObjectPlacement_ is an abstract supertype for the special types defining the object coordinate system. The _IfcObjectPlacement_ has to be provided for each product that has a shape representation.

The object placement can be given:

* absolute: by an axis2 placement, relative to the world coordinate system,
* relative: by an axis2 placement, relative to the object placement of another product,
* by grid reference: by the virtual intersection and reference direction given by two axes of a design grid,
* linear placement: by distance along a curve, with possible offsets.

In any case the object placement has to unambiguously define the object coordinate system as either two-dimensional axis placement (_IfcAxis2Placement2D_) or three-dimensional axis placement (_IfcAxis2Placement3D_). The axis placement may have to be calculated.
