An abstract entity defining common information about horizontal and vertical alignment segments.

> NOTE&nbsp; The start and end tag are defined as annotations, not as referents along the alignment. Only absolute distance expressions are in scope, not distances ahead or behind a referent, such as a station. However such information can be exchanged as tags.
