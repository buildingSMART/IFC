The vertical circular arc segment is defined as an arc using the inherited attributes from _IfcAlignment2DVerticalSegment_ and the following additional curve parameters _Radius_ as the radius of the circular arc, and _IsConvex_ to indicate the whether the circular arc defines a sag (i.e. concave, increasing gradiant) or a crest (i.e. convex, decreasing gradiant).

The circular arc is described by:

* x = offset as length measure relative to start of curve segment (i.e. 0 is at head).
* g~1~ = _StartGradient_ as ratio measure
*  
* R = _Radius_ as length measure

For crest curves (where _IsConvex_ is True), the elevation of a point along the curve (relative to _StartHeight_) is defined as:

For sag curves (where _IsConvex_ is False), the elevation of a point along the curve (relative to _StartHeight_) is defined as:
