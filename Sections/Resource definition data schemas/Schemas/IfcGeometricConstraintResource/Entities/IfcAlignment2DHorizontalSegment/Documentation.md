Individual segment along the _IfcAlignment2DHorizontal_, being defined in the x/y coordinate space. Each single horizontal alignment segment has an associated curve geometry. The following segment curve types are defined by the _CurveGeometry_:

* for line segment - _IfcLineSegment2D_
* circular arc segment - _IfcCircularArcSegment2D_
* clothoidal arc segment - _IfcClothoidalArcSegment2D_

For each horizontal segment, the following non-redundant information is provided:

* the start point (in x/y coordinates)
* the start direction (in radians or degree, with local x (east) being 0, and increasing counter-clock wise)
* the segment length
* the curve parameter needed for circular and clothoidal arc segments

The following information can be calculated (and is therefore not exchanged explicitly to avoid redundancy and inconsistencies)

* the end point (from start point, direction, segment length and curve parameter)
* the start distance along (from the end distance along of the previous segment, or the start distance along of the horizontal alignment (if it is the first segment)
* the end distance along (from the start distance and the segment length)
* the end direction (from the curve parameter, the start direction and the segment length)
* the point of intersection (from the start direction and the end direction)

The following checks can be done to validate the correct exchange:

* continuity – does the calculated end point of the previous segment matches with the provided start point of this segment
* tangential continuity – does the calculated end direction of the previous segment matches with the provided start direction of this segment
