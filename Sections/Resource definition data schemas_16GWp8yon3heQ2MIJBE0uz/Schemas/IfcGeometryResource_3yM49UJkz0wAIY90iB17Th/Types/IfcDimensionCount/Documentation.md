**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42**:1992: A dimension count is a positive integer used to define the coordinate space dimensionality.

The _IfcDimensionCount_ is restricted to have the dimensionality of either 1, 2, or 3 - the WR1 had been added as an addition to the STEP P42 entity dimension_count. In contrary to the STEP P42 constraint, that all geometric representation items within a geometric representation context are forced to have the same dimension count, the IFC geometry allows mixed dimensions, particularly when defining the boundary of planar surfaces.
