The _IfcArcIndex_ describes a single circular arc segment within a poly curve by providing a list on indices. The first index is the start point of the circular arc, the second index is a point on arc, the third index is the end point of the circular arc. The three points shall not be co-linear.

> NOTE&nbsp; The type is used for _IfcIndexedPolyCurve_ to point into an _IfcCartesianPointList_ for providing the Cartesian points of the circular arc segments of the poly curve.
