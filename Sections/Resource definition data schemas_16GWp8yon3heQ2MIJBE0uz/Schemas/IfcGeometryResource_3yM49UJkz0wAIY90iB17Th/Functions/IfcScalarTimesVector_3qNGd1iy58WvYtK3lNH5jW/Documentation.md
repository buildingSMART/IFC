**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: This function returns the vector that is the scalar multiple of the input vector. It accepts as input a scalar and a 'vector' which may be either a Direction or a Vector. The output is a Vector of the same units as the input vector or unitless if a direction is input. If either input argument is undefined then the returned vector is also undefined.
