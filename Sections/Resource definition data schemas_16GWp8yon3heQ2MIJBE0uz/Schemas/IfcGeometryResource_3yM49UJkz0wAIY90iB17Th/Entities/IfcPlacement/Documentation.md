An _IfcPlacement_ is an abstract supertype of placement subtypes that define the location of an item, or an entire shape representation, and provide its orientation. All placement subtypes define right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems and do not allow mirroring.

> NOTE&nbsp; Cartesian transformations including mirroring and scaling are supported by _IfcCartesianTransformationOperator_

> A placement locates a geometric item with respect to the coordinate system of its geometric context. It locates the item to be defined and, in the case of the axis placement subtypes, gives its orientation.
