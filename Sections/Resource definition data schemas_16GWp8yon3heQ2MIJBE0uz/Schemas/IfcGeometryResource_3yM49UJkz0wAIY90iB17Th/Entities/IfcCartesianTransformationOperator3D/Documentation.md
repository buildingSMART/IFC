> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> A Cartesian transformation operator 3d defines a geometric transformation in three-dimensional space composed of translation, rotation, mirroring and uniform scaling. The list of normalized vectors u defines the columns of an orthogonal matrix **T**. These vectors are computed from the direction attributes axis1, axis2 and axis3 by the base axis function. If |**T**|= -1, the transformation includes mirroring.
