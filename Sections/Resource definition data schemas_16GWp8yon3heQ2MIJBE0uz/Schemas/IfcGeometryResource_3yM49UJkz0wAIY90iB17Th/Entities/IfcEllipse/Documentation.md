An _IfcEllipse_ is a curve consisting of a set of points whose distances to two fixed points add to the same constant.

The inherited _SELF\IfcConic.Position.Location_ is the center of the _IfcEllipse_, and the inherited S_ELF\IfcConic.Position.Position.P[1]_ is the direction of the _SemiAxis1_.

> An ellipse is a conic section defined by the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor diameters and the position (center or mid point of the line joining the foci) and orientation of the curve. Interpretation of the data shall be as follows:

>> 
>> ```
>> C = position.location  
>> x = position.p[1]  
>> y = position.p[2]  
>> z = position.p[3]  
>> R1 = semi axis 1  
>> R2 = semi axis 2
