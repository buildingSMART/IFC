> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> A Cartesian transformation operator 2d defines a geometric transformation in two-dimensional space composed of translation, rotation, mirroring and uniform scaling. The list of normalized vectors u defines the columns of an orthogonal matrix **T**. These vectors are computed from the direction attributes axis1 and axis2 by the base axis function. If **|T|= -1**, the transformation includes mirroring.
