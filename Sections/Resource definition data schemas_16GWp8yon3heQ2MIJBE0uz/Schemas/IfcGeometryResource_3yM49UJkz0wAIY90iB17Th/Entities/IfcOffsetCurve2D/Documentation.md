> An offset curve 2d is a curve at a constant distance from a basis curve in two-dimensional space. This entity defines a simple plane-offset curve by offsetting by distance along the normal to basis curve in the plane of basis curve. The underlying curve shall have a well-defined tangent direction at every point. In the case of a composite curve, the transition code between each segment shall be cont same gradient or cont same gradient same curvature. 
>> NOTE&nbsp; The offset curve 2d may differ in nature from the basis curve; the offset of a non self- intersecting curve can be self-intersecting. Care should be taken to ensure that the offset to a continuous curve does not become discontinuous.
>  The offset curve 2d takes its parameterization from the basis curve. The offset curve 2d is parameterized as:
