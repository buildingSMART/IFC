**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: A point defined by its coordinates in a two or three dimensional rectangular Cartesian coordinate system, or in a two dimensional parameter space. The entity is defined in a two or three dimensional space.

The derived attribute _Dim_ has been added (see also note at _IfcGeometricRepresentationItem_). The WR1 was added to constrain the usage of _IfcCartesianPoint_ in the context of IFC geometry. For the purpose of defining geometry in IFC only two and three dimensional Cartesian points are used.
