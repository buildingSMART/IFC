> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> This entity defines a general direction vector in two or three dimensional space. The actual magnitudes of the components have no effect upon the direction being defined, only the ratios X:Y:Z or X:Y are significant.

> NOTE&nbsp; The components of this entity are not normalized. If a unit vector is required it should be normalized before use.

> NOTE&nbsp; Entity adapted from **direction** defined in ISO 10303-42.
