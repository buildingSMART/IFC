> The direction and location in three dimensional space of a single axis. An axis1_placement is defined in terms of a locating point (inherited from placement supertype) and an axis direction: this is either the direction of axis or defaults to (0.0,0.0,1.0). The actual direction for the axis placement is given by the derived attribute z.
