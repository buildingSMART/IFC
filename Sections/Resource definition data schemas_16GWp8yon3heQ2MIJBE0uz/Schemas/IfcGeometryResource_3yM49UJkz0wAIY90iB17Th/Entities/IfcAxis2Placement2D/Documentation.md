The _IfcAxis2Placement2D_ provides location and orientation to place items in a two-dimensional space. The attribute _RefDirection_ defines the x axis, the y axis is derived. If the attribute _RefDirection_ is not given, the placement defaults to P[1] (x-axis) as [1.,0.] and P[2] (y-axis) as [0.,1.].

> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> The location and orientation in two dimensional space of two mutually perpendicular axes. An axis2_placement_2d is defined in terms of a point, (inherited from the placement supertype), and an axis. It can be used to locate and originate an object in two dimensional space and to define a placement coordinate system. The entity includes a point which forms the origin of the placement coordinate system. A direction vector is required to complete the definition of the placement coordinate system. The reference direction defines the placement X axis direction, the placement Y axis is derived from this.
