This is a collection of mechanical properties applicable to wood-based materials for beam-like products, especially laminated materials like glulam and LVL.
Anisotropy of such materials is taken into account by different properties according to grain direction and load types.

All values shall be given for a standardized service condition, a standardized load duration and a standardized reference size of the member according to local design codes.

NOTE: In cases where mechanical material properties are graduated for different given reference sizes, separate instances of IfcExtendedMaterialProperties and IfcMaterial have to be used for each required graduation. Mechanically differing versions of a material are treated as different materials.

References to the orientation of grain or lay-up correspond to material orientation given by geometrical or topological representation of element objects or types, especially IfcMemberType and IfcStructuralMember.
