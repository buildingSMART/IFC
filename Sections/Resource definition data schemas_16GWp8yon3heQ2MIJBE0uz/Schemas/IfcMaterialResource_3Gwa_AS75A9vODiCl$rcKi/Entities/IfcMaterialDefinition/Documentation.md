_IfcMaterialDefinition_ is a general supertype for all material related information items in IFC that have common material related properties that may include association of material with some shape parameters or assignments to identified parts of a component.

There are three ways of assigning materials to a single component or multiple components; they are characterized as:

* by layer - assigning a material to a layer with constant thickness
* by profile - assigning a material to a profile with a constant of varying shape along an extrusion
* by constituents - assigning a material to an identified part of a component shape; the identification is by a keyword rather than by a shape parameter

Each instantiable subtype of _IfcMaterialDefinition_ may have material properties assigned, or have an external classification of its definition. It can be assigned to either a subtype of _IfcElement_, or a subtype of _IfcElementType_ by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_.
