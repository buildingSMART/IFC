The _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ is a designation by which individual material(s) of a prismatic element (for example, beam or column) constructed of a single or multiple material profiles is known.

> NOTE&nbsp; In case of multiple _MaterialProfiles_, the relative positioning of individual profiles in _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ are defined using the concept of _IfcCompositeProfileDef_ in _IfcProfileResource_ schema; otherwise, only one _MaterialProfile_ is given and defined by an individual _IfcProfileDef_ (subtype).
