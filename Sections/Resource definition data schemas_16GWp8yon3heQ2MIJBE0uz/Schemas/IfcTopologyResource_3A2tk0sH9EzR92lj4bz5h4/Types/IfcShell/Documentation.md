A type comprising different kinds of shell.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> This type collects together, for reference when constructing more complex models, the subtypes which have the characteristics of a shell. A shell is a connected object of fixed dimensionality d = 0; 1; or 2, typically used to bound a region. The domain of a shell, if present, includes its bounds and 0 &le; &Xi; &lt; &infin;. > * A shell of dimensionality 0 is represented by a graph consisting of a single vertex. The vertex shall not have any associated edges.
> * A shell of dimensionality 1 is represented by a connected graph of dimensionality 1.
> * A shell of dimensionality 2 is a topological entity constructed by joining faces along edges. Its domain, if present, is a connected, orientable 2-manifold with boundary, that is, a connected, oriented, finite, non-self-intersecting surface, which may be closed or open.
