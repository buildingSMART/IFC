The _IfcTextFontSelect_ allows for either a predefined text font, a text font model or an externally defined text font to be used to describe the font of a text literal. The definition of the text font model is based on W3C TR Cascading Style Sheet Version 1, whereas the definition of predefined text font is based on ISO 10303.
