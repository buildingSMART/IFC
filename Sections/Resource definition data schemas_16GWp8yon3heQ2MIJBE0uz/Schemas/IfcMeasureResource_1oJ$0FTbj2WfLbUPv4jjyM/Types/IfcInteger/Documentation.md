A defined type of simple data type Integer. (Required since a select type, i.e. _IfcSimpleValue_, cannot include directly simple types in its select list).

In principle, the domain of _IfcInteger_ (being an Integer) is all integer numbers. Here the number of bits used for the IfcInteger representation is unconstrained, but in practice it is implementation specific.
