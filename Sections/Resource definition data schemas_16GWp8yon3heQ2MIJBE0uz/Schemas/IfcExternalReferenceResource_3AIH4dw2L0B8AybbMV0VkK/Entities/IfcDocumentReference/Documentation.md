An _IfcDocumentReference_ is a reference to the location of a document. The reference is given by a system interpretable _Location_ attribute (a URL string) where the document can be found, and an optional inherited internal reference _Identification_, which refers to a system interpretable position within the document. The optional inherited _Name_ attribute is meant to have meaning for human readers. Optional document metadata can also be captured through reference to _IfcDocumentInformation_.
