### Use Definitions
_IfcClassification_ identifies the classification system or source from which a classification notation is derived. The objective is to minimize the number of _IfcClassification_ objects contained within an IFC model. Ideally, each classification system or source used should have only one _IfcClassification_ object. However, because multiple classification is allowed, there may be many _IfcClassification_ objects used, each identifying a different classification system or source.
