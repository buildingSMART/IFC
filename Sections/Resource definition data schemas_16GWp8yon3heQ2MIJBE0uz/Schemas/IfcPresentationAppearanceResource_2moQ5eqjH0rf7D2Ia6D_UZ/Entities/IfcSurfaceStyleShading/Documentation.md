The _IfcSurfaceStyleShading_ allows for colour information and transparency used for shading and simple rendering. The surface colour is used for colouring or simple shading of the assigned surfaces and the transparency for identifying translucency, where 0.0 is completely opaque, and 1.0 is completely transparent.
