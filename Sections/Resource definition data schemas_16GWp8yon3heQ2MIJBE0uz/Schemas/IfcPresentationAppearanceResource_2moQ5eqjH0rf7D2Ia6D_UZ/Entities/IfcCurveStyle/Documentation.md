An _IfcCurveStyle_ provides the style table for presentation information assigned to geometric curves. The style is defined by a color, a font and a width. The _IfcCurveStyle_ defines curve patterns as model patterns, that is, the distance between visible and invisible segments of curve patterns are given in model space dimensions (that have to be scaled using the target plot scale).

Styles are intended to be shared by multiple _IfcStyledItem_'s, assigning the style to occurrences of (subtypes of) _IfcGeometricRepresentationItem_'s. Measures given to a font pattern or a curve width are given in global drawing length units.

> NOTE&nbsp; global units are defined at the single _IfcProject_ instance, given by _UnitsInContext:IfcUnitAssignment_, the same units are used for the geometric representation items and for the style definitions.

The measure values for font pattern and curve width apply to the model space with a target plot scale provided for the correct appearance in the default plot scale.. For different scale and projection dependent curve styles a different instance of _IfcCurveStyle_ needs to be used by _IfcPresentationStyleAssignment_ for different _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ dependent representations.

> NOTE&nbsp; the target plot scale is given by _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext.TargetScale_.

An _IfcCurveStyle_ can be assigned to _IfcGeometricRepresentationItem_'s via the _IfcPresentationStyleAssignment_ through an intermediate _IfcStyledItem_ or _IfcAnnotationCurveOccurrence_.
