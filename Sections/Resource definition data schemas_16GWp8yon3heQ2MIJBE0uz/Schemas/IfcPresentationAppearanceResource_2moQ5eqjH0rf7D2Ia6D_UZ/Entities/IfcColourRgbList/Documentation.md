The _IfcColourRgbList_ defines an ordered collection of RGB colour values. Each colour value is a fixed list of three colour components (red, green, blue). The attribute _ColourList_ is a two-dimensional list, where:

* first dimension is an unbounded list representing each colour value;
* second dimension is a fixed list of four list members, where [1] is the red component, [2] the green component, and [3] the blue component.

> NOTE&nbsp; The _IfcColourRgbList_ is introduced to provide a compact representation of an indexable representation of colours for tessellated items.
