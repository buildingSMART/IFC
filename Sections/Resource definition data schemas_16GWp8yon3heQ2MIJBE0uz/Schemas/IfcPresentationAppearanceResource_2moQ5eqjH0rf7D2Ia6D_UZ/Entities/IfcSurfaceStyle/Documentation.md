_IfcSurfaceStyle_ is an assignment of one or many surface style elements to a surface, defined by subtypes of _IfcSurface_, _IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel_, _IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel_, or by subtypes of _IfcSolidModel_. The positive direction of the surface normal relates to the positive side. In case of solids the outside of the solid is to be taken as positive side.

> NOTE&nbsp; The surface style is often referred to as material definition in rendering applications.

> NOTE&nbsp; Corresponding ISO 10303 entity: surface_style_usage and surface_side_style. Please refer to ISO/IS 10303-46:1994 for the final definition of the formal standard. The surface style definition in regard to support of rendering has been greatly expanded beyond the scope of ISO/IS 10303-46.
