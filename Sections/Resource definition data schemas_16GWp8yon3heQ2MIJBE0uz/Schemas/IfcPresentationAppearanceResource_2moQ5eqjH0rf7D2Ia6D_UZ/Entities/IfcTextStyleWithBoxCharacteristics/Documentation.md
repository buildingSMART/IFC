**Definition
from IAI**: The text style with box characteristics allows the presentation of annotated text by specifying the characteristics of the character boxes of the text and the spacing between the character boxes.

> <small>
NOTE&nbsp; The <i>IfcTextStyleWithBoxCharacteristics</i>
is an entity that had been adopted from ISO 10303, Industrial
automation systems and integration&mdash;Product data
representation and exchange, Part 46: Integrated generic resources:
Visual presentation.</small>

The _IfcTextStyleWithBoxCharacteristics_ is mainly used to provide some compatibility with ISO10303. Its usage is restricted to monospace text fonts (having uniform character boxes) and simple vector based text fonts. For true text fonts however the use of _IfcTextStyleTextModel_ is required.
