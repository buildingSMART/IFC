The schema _IfcPresentationAppearanceResource_ defines the resources used for geometric representations and presentations of styled items. The primary application of this resource is for presenting the annotation occurrences of curve, text, filled area, symbol, and surfaces.

> <font color="#0000FF" size="-1">NOTE: The definitions of this
		resource of the IFC model have been taken from the International Standard
		10303: "Industrial automation systems and integration - Product data
		representation and exchange", Part 46 "Integrated generic resources: Visual
		presentation". The reference of the final international standard is ISO/IS
		10303-46:1994. The <i>IfcPresentationAppearanceResource</i> refers to the
		clause 6, "Presentation appearance" of the standard.</font>

The definitions taken from ISO/IS 10303-46:1994 have undergone a adaptation process, characterized by:

* adaptation of the IFC naming convention (inner majuscules and Ifc prefix)
* adaptation of the STEP entities, where multiple inheritance or non-exclusive inheritance (i.e. AND or ANDOR subtype constraints) are used
* selection of a subset of the IR, using subtype and select pruning
* dimensionality of geometric representation items defined at each item (not through the representation context)
* omission of the name attribute at the representation item

In addition to the adaptations from ISO/IS 10303-46:1994 the following changes and additions have been made:

* surface styles, including the definition of lighting and rendering properties and surface textures, are defined according to an adaptation of definitions from 
    * ISO/IEC 14772-1: 1997: The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) specification
    * ISO/IEC FCD 19775:200x, the Extensible 3D (X3D) specification
The semantic definitions of _IfcPresentationAppearanceResource_ are defined following the adaptation of the **ISO/CD 10303-46:1992**, _Industrial Automation Systems and Integration: Product Data Representation
		and Exchange - Part 46: Integrated Generic Resources. Visual presentation_. The type, class, and function semantic definition sections follow the adapted wording of the working draft, which is clearly indicated and quoted at each reference.

The definitions of all parts of the _IfcPresentationAppearanceResource_, that are taken from ISO10303-46, ISO/IEC 14772-1, or ISO/IEC FCD 19775, are explicitly excluded from the copyright of the International Alliance of Interoperability.

    * curve
    * text
    * filled area
    * symbol
