**Definition
from CSS1 (W3C
Recommendation)**:&nbsp;This property describes how text is aligned within the element. The actual justification algorithm used is user agent and human language dependent. If 'justify' is not supported, the user agent will supply a replacement. Typically, this will be 'left' for western languages. Values are:

* left
* right
* center
* justify
