The _IfcReflectanceMethodEnum_ defines the range of different reflectance methods available.

Enumerated item definitions:

* **BLINN**: A reflectance model providing a smooth, slightly shiny appearance.
* **FLAT**: A reflectance model providing a constant colour. This model ignores the effect of all light sources.
* **GLASS**: A reflectance model that supports an approximation of glass-like materials that have both reflective and transmissive properties.
* **MATT**: A reflectance model providing a dull matte appearance.
* **METAL**: A reflectance model providing a specular metallic appearance.
* **MIRROR**: A reflectance model that supports secondary mirrored views through ray tracing.
* **PHONG**: A reflectance model conforming with the Phong model in which reflections are greatest in the `mirror' direction of a surface opposite the viewing direction with respect to the surface normal.
* **PLASTIC**: A reflectance model providing a specular effect which is similar to the Phong model.
* **STRAUSS**: A reflectance model for metallic and non-metallic appearance based on a limited set of control parameter.
* **NOTDEFINED**
