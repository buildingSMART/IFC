_IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ defines the context that applies to several shape representations of a product being a sub context, sharing the _WorldCoordinateSystem_, _CoordinateSpaceDimension_, _Precision_ and _TrueNorth_ attributes with the parent _IfcGeometricRepresentationContext_.

The _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ is used to define semantically distinguished representation types for different information content, dependent on the representation view and the target scale. It can be used to control the level of detail of the shape representation that is most applicable to this geometric representation context. In addition the sub context is used to control the later appearance of the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ within a plot view.

> NOTE&nbsp; If the _IfcShapeRepresentation_ using this sub context has_IfcStyledItem_'s assigned to the _Items_, the presentation style information (e.g. _IfcCurveStyle_, _IfcTextStyle_) associated with the _IfcStyledItem_ is given in target plot dimensions. For example, a line thickness (_IfcCurveStyle.CurveWidth_) is given by a thickness measure relating to the thickness for a plot within the (range of) target scale.

Each _IfcProduct_ can then have several instances of subtypes of _IfcRepresentation_, each being assigned to a different _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_). The applicable values for the inherited _ContextIdentifier_ attribute shall be identical to the _RepresentationIdentifier_ attrubute defined at _IfcShapeRepresentation_.

> NOTE&nbsp; The provision of a model view (_IfcGeometricRepresentationContext.ContextType_ = 'Model') is mandatory. Instances of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ relate to it as its _ParentContext_.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; Instances of _IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext_ can be used to handle the multi-view blocks or macros, which are used in CAD programs to store several scale and/or view dependent geometric representations of the same object. The application can then choose the most appropriate representation for showing the geometric shape of the product, depending on the target view and scale.
