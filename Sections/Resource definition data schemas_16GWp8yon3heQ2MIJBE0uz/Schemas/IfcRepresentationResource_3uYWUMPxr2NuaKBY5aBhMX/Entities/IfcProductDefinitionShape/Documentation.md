The _IfcProductDefinitionShape_ defines all shape relevant information about an _IfcProduct_. It allows for multiple geometric shape representations of the same product. The shape relevant information includes:

* the shape representation including geometric representation items (for 3D solids, 2D annotations, etc.) and: 
    * associated presentation information (line color, line type, surface rendering properties)
    * assignment to presentation layers (CAD layers for visibility control) 
* or the topological representation items for connectivity systems (vertex, edge, face representations) that may include geometric representation items (vertex points, edge curves, face surfaces)

> NOTE&nbsp; The definition of this entity relates to the ISO 10303 entity product_definition_shape. Please refer to ISO/IS 10303-41:1994 for the final definition of the formal standard.
