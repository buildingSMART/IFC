The _IfcCoordinateReferenceSystem_ is a definition of a coordinate reference system by means of qualified identifiers only. The interpretation of the identifier is expected to be well-known to the receiving software.

> NOTE&nbsp; Definition from OpenGIS Abstract Specification, Topic 2:  
> A coordinate reference system is a coordinate system which is related to the real world by a datum. The coordinate system is composed of a set of coordinate axes with specified units of measure. The datum specifies the relationship of a coordinate system to the earth. The resulting combination of coordinate system and datum is a coordinate reference system.

The unambiguous identifier by which the coordinate reference system is know, is stored in the _Name_ attribute. Well defined identifiers include the geodetic and often also the vertical datum. In these cases the _GeodeticDatum_ and the _VerticalDatum_ can be omitted.

> EXAMPLE&nbsp; The identifier 'EPSG:25832' defines the geodetic datum 'ETRS89' in additon to the projection and the zone. 'EPSG:5555' defined the geodetic datum 'ETRS89' and the vertical datum 'DHHN92'.

> NOTE&nbsp; One widely-used, publicly-available authority is the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG), and use of this authority is currently specified in several OGC Implementation Specifications. Software used to transport IFC engineering models into GIS applications (and vice versa) is expected to have knowledge about the OGC Implementation Specifications.
