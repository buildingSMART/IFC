> NOTE&nbsp; Definition from OpenGIS Abstract Specification, Topic 2:  
> A coordinate reference system is a coordinate system which is related to the real world by a datum. The coordinate system is composed of a set of coordinate axes with specified units of measure. The datum specifies the relationship of a coordinate system to the earth. The resulting combination of coordinate system and datum is a coordinate reference system.

> NOTE&nbsp; One widely-used, publicly-available authority is the European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG), and use of this authority is currently specified in several OGC Implementation Specifications. Software used to transport IFC engineering models into GIS applications (and vice versa) is expected to have knowledge about the OGC Implementation Specifications.
