The _IfcConnectionPortGeometry_ is used to describe the geometric constraints that facilitate the physical connection of two objects at a port having a profile geometry (here _IfcProfile_). It is envisioned as a control that applies to the element connection relationships.

This entity defines the geometric location and configuration of a port on a distribution element. This information can be used to determine how to physically connect distribution elements.
