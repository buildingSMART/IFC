_IfcTimePeriod_ defines a time period given by a start and end time. Both time definitions consider the time zone and allow for the daylight savings offset.

A time period is defined by a start and an end time, which is defined by _IfcTime_. The given time period should be within reasonable values (for example, the start time must be before the end time). It is furthermore expected that both time definitions use the same time zone and, if given, the same daylight saving offset.
