A time series is a set of a time-stamped data entries. It allows a natural association of data collected over intervals of time. Time series can be regular or irregular. In regular time series data arrive predictably at predefined intervals. In irregular time series some or all time stamps do not follow a repetitive pattern and unpredictable bursts of data may arrive at unspecified points in time.

The modeling of buildings and their performance involves data that are generated and recorded over a period of time. Such data cover a large spectrum, from weather data to schedules of all kinds to status measurements to reporting to everything else that has a time related aspect. Their correct placement in time is essential for their proper understanding and use, and the _IfcTimeSeries_ subtypes provide the appropriate data structures to accommodate these types of data.
