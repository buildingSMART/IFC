_IfcWorkTime_ defines time periods that are used by _IfcWorkCalendar_ for either describing working times or non-working exception times. Besides start and finish dates, a set of time periods can be given by various types of recurrence patterns.

A work time should have a meaningful name that describes the time periods (for example, working week, holiday name). Non-recurring time periods should have a start date (_IfcWorkTime.Start_) and a finish date (_IfcWorkTime.Finish_). In that case it is assumed that the time period begins at 0:00 on the start date and ends at 24:00 on the finish date.

The start and finish date is optional if a recurrence pattern is given (_IfcWorkTime.RecurrencePattern_). They then restrict never-ending recurrence patterns.
