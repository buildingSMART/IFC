The property with a single value _IfcPropertySingleValue_ defines a property object which has a single (numeric or descriptive) value assigned. It defines a property - single value combination for which the property _Name_, an optional _Description_, and an optional _NominalValue_ with measure type is provided. In addition, the default unit as specified within the project unit context can be overriden by assigning an _Unit_.

The unit is handled by the _Unit_ attribute, see Table 1 for an example of various single value properties:

* If the _Unit_ attribute is not given, then the unit is already implied by the type of _IfcMeasureValue_ or _IfcDerivedMeasureValue_. The associated unit can be found at the _IfcUnitAssignment_ globally defined at the project level (_IfcProject.UnitsInContext_).
* If the _Unit_ attribute is given, then the unit assigned by the _Unit_ attribute overrides the globally assigned unit.
