_IfcPropertyEnumeration_ is a collection of simple or measure values that define a prescribed set of alternatives from which 'enumeration values' are selected. This enables inclusion of enumeration values in property sets. _IfcPropertyEnumeration_ provides a name for the enumeration as well as a list of unique (numeric or descriptive) values (that may have a measure type assigned). The entity defines the list of potential enumerators to be exchanged together (or separately) with properties of type _IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue_ that selects their actual property values from this enumeration.

The unit is handled by the _Unit_ attribute, see Table 1 for an example of a unitless property enumeration:

* If the _Unit_ attribute is not given, than the unit is already implied by the type of _IfcMeasureValue_ or _IfcDerivedMeasureValue_. The associated unit can be found at the _IfcUnitAssignment_ globally defined at the project level (_IfcProject.UnitsInContext_).
*  If the _Unit_ attribute is given, the unit assigned by the unit attribute overrides the globally assigned unit.
