An _IfcPresentationLayerAssignmentWithStyle_ extends the presentation layer assignment with capabilities to define visibility control, access control and common style information.

The visibility control allows to define a layer to be either 'on' or 'off', and/or 'frozen' or 'not&nbsp;frozen'. The access control allows to block graphical entities from manipulations by setting a layer to be either 'blocked' or 'not blocked'. Common style information can be given to the layer.

> <small>NOTE &nbsp;Style information assigned to
layers is often
restricted to 'layer colour', 'curve font', and/or 'curve width'. These
styles are assigned by using the <i>IfcCurveStyle</i>
within the <i>LayerStyles</i>.<br>
  <br>
NOTE: If a styled item
is assigned to a layer using the <i>IfcPresentationLayerAssignmentWithStyle</i>,
it inherits the style information from the layer. In this case, it
should omit its own style information. If the styled item has style
information assigned (e.g. by <i>IfcCurveStyle,
IfcFillAreaStyle, IfcTextStyle, IfcSurfaceStyle, IfcSymbolStyle</i>),&nbsp;
then it overrides the style provided by the <i>IfcPresentationLayerAssignmentWithStyle</i>.</small>
