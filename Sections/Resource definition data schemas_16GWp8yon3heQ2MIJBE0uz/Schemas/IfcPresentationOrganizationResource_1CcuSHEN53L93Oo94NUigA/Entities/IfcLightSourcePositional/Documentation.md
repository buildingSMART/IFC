> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 10303-46:  
> The light source positional entity is a subtype of light source. This entity has a light source position and attenuation coefficients. A positional light source affects a surface based on the surface's orientation and position.

> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997:  
> The Point light node specifies a point light source at a 3D location in the local coordinate system. A point light source emits light equally in all directions; that is, it is omnidirectional. Point light nodes are specified in the local coordinate system and are affected by ancestor transformations.

{ .extDef}
> Point light node's illumination falls off with distance as specified by three attenuation coefficients. The attenuation factor is 
>> 1/max(attenuation[0] + attenuation[1] &times; r + attenuation[2] &times; r 2 , 1),
>  where r is the distance from the light to the surface being illuminated. The default is no attenuation. An attenuation value of (0, 0, 0) is identical to (1, 0, 0). Attenuation values shall be greater than or equal to zero.

> NOTE&nbsp; Corresponding ISO 10303 entity: light_source_positional. Please refer to ISO/IS 10303-46:1994, p. 32 for the final definition of the formal standard.

> NOTE&nbsp; In addition to the attributes as defined in ISO10303-46 the additional property from ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997 (VRML) _Radius_ and _QuadricAttenuation_ are added to this subtype and the _AmbientIntensity_ and _Intensity_ are inherited from the supertype.
