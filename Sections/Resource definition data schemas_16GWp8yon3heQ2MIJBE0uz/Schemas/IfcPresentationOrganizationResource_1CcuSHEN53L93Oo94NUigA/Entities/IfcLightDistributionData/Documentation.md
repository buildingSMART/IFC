_IfcLightDistributionData_ defines the luminous intensity of a light source given at a particular main plane angle. It is based on some standardized light distribution curves; the _MainPlaneAngle_ is either the

* A angle; if the _IfcLightDistributionCurveEnum_ is set to TYPE_A
* B angle; if the _IfcLightDistributionCurveEnum_ is set to TYPE_B
* C angle; if the _IfcLightDistributionCurveEnum_ is set to TYPE_C

For each _MainPlaneAngle_ (considered as being the row of a table) a list of _SecondaryPlaneAngle'_s are given (considered to be the columns of a table). They are either the:

* &#945; angle; if the _IfcLightDistributionCurveEnum_ is set to TYPE_A
* &#946; angle; if the _IfcLightDistributionCurveEnum_ is set to TYPE_B
* &#947; angle; if the _IfcLightDistributionCurveEnum_ is set to TYPE_C

For each pair of _MainPlaneAngle_ and _SecondaryPlaneAngle_ the _LuminousIntensity_ is provided (the unit is given by the _IfcUnitAssignment_ referring to the LuminousIntensityDistributionUnit, normally cd/klm).
