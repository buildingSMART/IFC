> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997:  
> The directional light node defines a directional light source that illuminates along rays parallel to a given 3-dimensional vector. Directional light nodes do not attenuate with distance. Directional light nodes are specified in the local coordinate system and are affected by ancestor transformations.

> NOTE&nbsp; Corresponding ISO 10303 entity: light_source_directional. Please refer to ISO/IS 10303-46:1994, p. 32 for the final definition of the formal standard.

> NOTE&nbsp; In addition to the attributes as defined in ISO 10303-46 the additional property from ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997 (VRML) _AmbientIntensity_ and _Intensity_ are inherited from the supertype.
