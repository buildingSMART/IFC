The schema _IfcPresentationOrganizationResource_ defines the resources used for geometric representations and presentations of styled items. The primary application of this resource is for presenting the annotation occurrences of curve, text, filled area, symbol, and surfaces. The organization resource focusses on the provision of layer assignments and light objects.

> <font color="#0000ff" size="-1">NOTE:
The definitions of this resource of the IFC model have been taken from
the International Standard 10303: "Industrial automation systems and
integration - Product data representation and exchange", Part 46
"Integrated generic resources: Visual presentation". The reference of
the final international standard is ISO/IS 10303-46:1994. The <i>IfcPresentationOrganizationResource</i>
refers to the clause 4, "Presentation organization" of the standard.</font>

The definitions taken from ISO/IS 10303-46:1994 have undergone a adaptation process, characterized by:

* adaptation of the IFC naming convention (inner majuscules and Ifc prefix)
* adaptation of the STEP entities, where multiple inheritance or non-exclusive inheritance (i.e. AND or ANDOR subtype constraints) are used
* selection of a subset of the IR, using subtype and select pruning
* dimensionality of geometric representation items defined at each item (not through the representation context)
* omission of the name attribute at the representation item

In addition to the adaptations from ISO/IS 10303-46:1994 the following changes and additions have been made:

* lighting sources have additional capabilities partially taken from 
    * ISO/IEC 14772-1: 1997: The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) specification 

The semantic definitions of _IfcPresentationAppearanceResource_ are defined following the adaptation of the **ISO/CD
10303-46:1992**, _Industrial Automation Systems and
Integration: Product Data Representation and Exchange - Part 46:
Integrated Generic Resources. Visual presentation_. The type, class, and function semantic definition sections follow the adapted wording of the working draft, which is clearly indicated and quoted at each reference.

The definitions of all parts of the _IfcPresentationAppearanceResource_, that are taken from ISO10303-46, or ISO/IEC 14772-1, are explicitly excluded from the copyright of the International Alliance of Interoperability.

The following is within the scope of the current versions of the presentation resources:

* definition of presentation style attributes for realistic and symbolic visualizations of geometric and non-geometric displayble elements in the product information, including presentation styles for 
    * curve
    * text
    * filled area
    * symbol
    * surface 
* support of externally defined character fonts and symbols;
* support of pre defined character fonts and symbols;
* image control by a layer mechanism.
