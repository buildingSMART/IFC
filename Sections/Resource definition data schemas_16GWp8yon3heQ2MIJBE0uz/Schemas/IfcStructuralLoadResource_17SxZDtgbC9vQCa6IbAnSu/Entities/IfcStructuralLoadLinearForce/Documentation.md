An instance of the entity _IfcStructuralLoadLinearForce_ shall be used to define actions on curves.

All values are given within the chosen coordinate system of the 'activity element' (subtypes of _IfcStructuralActivity_), either the local coordinate system of the activity element or the global project coordinate system which is referenced by the activity element as its geometric representation context. The units of the force and moment values are given within the global unit assignment (_IfcUnitAssignment_).
