The abstract entity _IfcBoundaryCondition_ is the supertype of all boundary conditions that can be applied to structural connection definitions, either directly for the connection (e.g. the joint) or for the relation between a structural member and the connection.

> NOTE&nbsp; The boundary conditions are used within other parts, mainly by instances of _IfcStructuralConnection_ (for the definition of supports) and instances of _IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember_ (for the definition of connections between structural members and structural connections).

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2.
