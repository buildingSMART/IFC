**Definition
from IAI:** The abstract entity _IfcBoundaryCondition_ is the supertype of all boundary conditions that can be applied to structural connection definitions, either directly for the connection (e.g. the joint) or for the relation between a structural member and the connection.

> <font size="-1">NOTE: The boundary conditions are used
within other parts, mainly by instances of <i>IfcStructuralConnection</i>
(for the definition of supports) and instances of <i>IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember</i>
(for the definition of connections between structural members and
structural connections). </font>
