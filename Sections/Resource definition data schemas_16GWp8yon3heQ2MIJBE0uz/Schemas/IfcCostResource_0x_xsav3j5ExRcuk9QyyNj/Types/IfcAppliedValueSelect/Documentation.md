Selecting _IfcMeasureWithUnit_ allows the specification of both the actual figure for the value together with the currency (for a cost value) or an environmental measurement unit (in the case of an environmental impact value) in which the value is represented.

Selecting _IfcMonetaryMeasure_ allows the specification only of the value, the currency being as set by the global context

Selecting _IfcRatioMeasure_ assumes that the amount is a percentage or other REAL number. Note that if the amount is normally specified as -20%, then this figure will need to be converted to a multiplier of 0.8
