**Use Definitions**

Each instance of IfcCostValue may also have a CostType. There are many possible types of cost value that may be identified. Whilst there is a broad understanding of the meaning of names that may be assigned to different types of costs, there is no general standard for naming cost types nor are there any broadly defined classifications. To allow for any type of cost value, the IfcLabel datatype is assigned. The following defines some cost types that might be applied:

<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Annual rate of return</td> 
		  <td width="209">Lease</td> 
		  <td width="209">Replacement</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Bonus</td> 
		  <td width="209">List price</td> 
		  <td width="209">Sale</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Bulk purchase rebate</td> 
		  <td width="209">Maintenance</td> 
		  <td width="209">Small quantity surcharge</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Contract</td> 
		  <td width="209">Material</td> 
		  <td width="209">Spares</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Consultancy</td> 
		  <td width="209">Overhead</td> 
		  <td width="209">Storage</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Delivery</td> 
		  <td width="209">Postage and packing</td> 
		  <td width="209">Sub-Contract</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Estimated cost</td> 
		  <td width="209">Profit</td> 
		  <td width="209">Trade discount</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Hire</td> 
		  <td width="209">Purchase</td> 
		  <td width="209">Transportation</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Installation</td> 
		  <td width="209">Rental</td> 
		  <td width="209">Waste allowance</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Interest rate</td> 
		  <td width="209">Repair</td> 
		  <td width="209">Whole life</td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td width="209">Labor</td> 
		  <td width="209"></td> 
		  <td width="209"></td> 
		</tr> 
	 </table>

In the absence of any well-defined standard, it is recommended that local agreements should be made to define allowable and understandable cost value types within a project or region.
