An advanced B-rep is a boundary representation model in which all faces, edges and vertices are explicitly represented. It is a solid with explicit topology and elementary or free-form geometry. The faces of the B-rep are of type _IfcAdvancedFace_. An advanced B-rep has to meet the same topological constraints as the manifold solid B-rep.

> NOTE&nbsp; The advanced B-rep has been introduced in order to support the increasing number of applications that can define and exchange B-rep models based on NURBS or other b-spline surfaces.

Informal Propositions:

1. each face is a face surface;
2. each face surface has its geometry defined by an elementary surface, swept surface or a b-spline surface;
3. the edges used to define the boundaries of the face shall all reference an edge curve
4. each curve used to define the geometry of the faces and face bounds shall be either a conic, or a line or a polyline or a b-spline curve
5. the edges used to define the face boundaries shall all be trimmed by vertices of type vertex point
6. no loop used to define a face bound shall be of the oriented subtype
