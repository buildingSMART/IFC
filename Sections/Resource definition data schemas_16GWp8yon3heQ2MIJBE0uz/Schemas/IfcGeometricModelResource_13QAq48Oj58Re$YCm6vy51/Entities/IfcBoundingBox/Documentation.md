**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992**: A box domain is an orthogonal box parallel to the axes of the geometric coordinate system which may be used to limit the domain of a half space solid. A box domain is specified by the coordinates of the bottom left corner, and the lengths of the sides measured in the directions of the coordinate axes.

Every semantic object having a physical extent might have a minimum default representation of a bounding box. The bounding box is therefore also used as minimal geometric representation for any geometrically represented object. Therefore the _IfcBoundingBox_ is subtyped from _IfcGeometricRepresentationItem_.
