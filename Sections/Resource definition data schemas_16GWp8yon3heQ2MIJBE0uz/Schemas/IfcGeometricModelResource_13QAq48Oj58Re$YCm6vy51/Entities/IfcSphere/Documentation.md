**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992:** A sphere is a CSG primitive with a spherical shape defined by a centre and a radius.

&nbsp;The inherited _Position_ attribute defines the _IfcAxis2Placement3D_ and provides:

* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position_: The location and orientation of the axis system for the primitive.&nbsp;
* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Location_: The center of the sphere..
* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Position[3]:_The z axis points at its positve direction towards the north pole, and by its negative directions towards the south pole.

texture covers the entire surface, wrapping counterclockwise from the
back of the sphere (i.e., longitudinal arc intersecting the +Y axis)
when viewed from the top of the sphere. The texture has a seam at the
back where the X=0 plane intersects the sphere and Y values are
positive. Texture Transform affects the texture coordinates of the
