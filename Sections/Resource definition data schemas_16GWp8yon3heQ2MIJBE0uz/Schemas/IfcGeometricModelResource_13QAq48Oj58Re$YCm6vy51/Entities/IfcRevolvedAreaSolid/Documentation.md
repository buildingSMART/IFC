An _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ is a solid created by revolving a cross section provided by a profile definition about an axis.

The resulting solid is positioned by the _IfcSweptAreaSolid_._Position_ relative to the object coordinate system. If provided, it allows to reposition the revolved solid. If not provided, it defaults to the current object coordinate system. The axis and the cross section shall be in the same plane, prior to any repositioning.

> NOTE&nbsp; Both the axis and the cross section are required to lie in the xy plane of the object position coordinate system.

> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992  
> A revolved area solid is a solid formed by revolving a planar bounded surface about an axis. The axis shall be in the plane of the surface and the axis shall not intersect the interior of the bounded surface. The bounded surface may have holes which will sweep into holes in the solid. The direction of revolution is clockwise when viewed along the axis in the positive direction. More precisely if **A** is the axis location and **d** is the axis direction and **C** is an arc on the surface of revolution generated by an arbitrary point **p** on the boundary of the swept area, then **C** leaves **p** in direction **d** x (**p** - **A**) as the area is revolved.

Informal Propositions:

1. The _AxisLine_ shall lie in the plane of the _SweptArea_ (as defined at supertype _IfcSweptAreaSolid_).
2. The _AxisLine_ shall not intersect the interior of the _SweptArea_ (as defined at supertype _IfcSweptAreaSolid_).
3. The _Angle_ shall be between 0&deg; and 360&deg;, or 0 and 2&pi; (depending on the unit type for _IfcPlaneAngleMeasure_).

Texture Use Definition

For side faces, textures are aligned facing upright along the sides with origin at the first point of an arbitrary profile, and following the outer bound of the profile counter-clockwise (as seen from above). For parameterized profiles, the origin is defined at the +Y extent for rounded profiles (having no sharp edge) and the first sharp edge counter-clockwise from the +Y extent for all other profiles. Textures are stretched or repeated on each side along the outer boundary of the profile according to _RepeatS_. Textures are stretched or repeated on each side along the outermost (longest) revolution path according to _RepeatT_, where coordinates are compressed towards the axis of revolution.

For top and bottom caps, textures are aligned facing front-to-back, with the origin at the minimum X and Y extent. Textures are stretched or repeated on the top and bottom to the extent of each face according to _RepeatS_ and _RepeatT_.

For profiles with voids, textures are aligned facing upright along the inner side with origin at the first point of an arbitrary profile, and following the inner bound of the profile clockwise (as seen from above). For parameterized profiles, the origin of inner sides is defined at the +Y extent for rounded profiles (having no sharp edge such as hollow ellipses or rounded rectangles) and the first sharp edge clockwise from the +Y extent for all other profiles.
