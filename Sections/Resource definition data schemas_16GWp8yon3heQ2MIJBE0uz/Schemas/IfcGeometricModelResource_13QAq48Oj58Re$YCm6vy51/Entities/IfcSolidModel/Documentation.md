**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992:** A solid model is a complete representation of the nominal shape of a product such that all points in the interior are connected. Any point can be classified as being inside, outside, or on the boundary of a solid. There are several different types of solid model representations.

		  solid_model, only three subtypes have been incorporated into the current IFC
		  Release - subset of manifold_solid_brep (<i>IfcManifoldSolidBrep</i>,
		  constraint to faceted B-rep), swept_area_solid (<i>IfcSweptAreaSolid</i>), the
		  swept_disk_solid (<i>IfcSweptDiskSolid</i>) and subset of csg_solid
		  (<i>IfcCsgSolid</i>). The derived attribute <i>Dim</i> has been added at this
		  level and was therefore demoted from the geometric_representation_item. Please
		  refer to ISO/IS 10303-42:1994, p. 170 for the final definition of the formal
		  standard. </font>
