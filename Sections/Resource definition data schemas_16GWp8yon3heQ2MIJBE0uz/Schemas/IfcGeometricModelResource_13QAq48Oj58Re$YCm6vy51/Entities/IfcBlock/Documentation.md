**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992:** A block is a solid rectangular parallelepiped, defined with a location and placement coordinate system. The block is specified by the positive lengths x, y, and z along the axes of the placement coordinate system, and has one vertex at the origin of the placement coordinate system.

&nbsp;The inherited _Position_ attribute defines the _IfcAxis2Placement3D_ and provides:

* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position_: The location and orientation of the axis system for the primitive.&nbsp;
* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Location_: The block has one vertex at location and the edges are aligned with the placement axes in the positive sense.
