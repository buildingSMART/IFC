**Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992:** A right circular cone is a CSG primitive in the form of a cone. It is defined by an axis, a point on the axis, (...) and a distance giving the location along the axis from the point to the base of the cone. In addition, a radius is given (...).

&nbsp;In contrary to the ISO/CD 10303-42 definition, the _IfcRightCircularCone_ may not be truncated. It provides:

* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position_: The location and orientation of the axis system for the primitive.&nbsp;
* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Location_: The center of the&nbsp;circular area being the bottom face of the cylinder.
* _SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Position[3]:_The z-axis of the inherited placement coordinate system provides the center axis of the&nbsp;_IfcRightCircularCone_, and the apex is at the _Height_ value applied to the positive direction of the z-axis. The _BottomRadius_ defines the circular base at the xy-plane of the&nbsp;placement coordinate system.&nbsp;_&nbsp;_

      <td colspan="2" rowspan="1" valign="top" width="420">When a texture is applied to the sides of the
cone, the texture wraps counterclockwise (from above) starting at the
back of the cone. The texture has a vertical seam at the back in the
X=0 plane, from the apex (0,&nbsp;0, <i>Height</i>) to
the point (0, <i>BottomRadius</i>, 0). For the bottom cap,
a circle is cut out of the texture square centred at (0, 0,&nbsp;0)
with dimensions (2&nbsp;&times; <i>BottomRadius)</i>
by (2&nbsp;&times; <i>BottomRadius)</i>. The
bottom cap texture appears right side up when the top of the cone is
rotated towards the -Z-axis. Texture Transform affects the texture
coordinates of the Cone.&nbsp;

axis, and the IFC cone is positioned at the bottom face, whereas in

Corresponding STEP entity: right_circular_cone, the position attribute

No semi_angle attribute, and the radius defines the bottom radius,
