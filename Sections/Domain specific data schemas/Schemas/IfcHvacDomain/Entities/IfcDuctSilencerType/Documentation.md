The element type _IfcDuctSilencerType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a duct silencer and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a duct silencer specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

> <font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A duct silencer type is used to define the common properties of a duct silencer that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A duct silencer is a device that is typically installed inside a duct distribution system for the purpose of reducing the noise levels from air movement, fan noise, etc. in the adjacent space or downstream of the duct silencer device. Duct silencer types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcDuctSilencerType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowTreatmentDevice_ or its subtypes.
