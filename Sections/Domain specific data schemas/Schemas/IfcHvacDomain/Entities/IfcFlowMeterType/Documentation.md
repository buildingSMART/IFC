The element type _IfcFlowMeterType_ defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of a flow meter and an optional set of product representations. It is used to define a flow meter specification (i.e. the specific product information, that is common to all occurrences of that product type).

> <font size="-1">
		NOTE: The product representations are defined as
		representation maps (at the level of the supertype <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, which
		get assigned by an element occurrence instance through the
		<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</i> being an
		<i>IfcMappedItem</i>.

A flow meter type is used to define the common properties of a flow meter that may be applied to many occurrences of that type. A flow meter is a device that is used to measure the flow rate in a system. flow meter types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.

The occurrences of the _IfcFlowMeterType_ are represented by instances of _IfcFlowController_ or its subtypes.

****Property Set Use Definition****:
