This enumeration defines the various types of damper:

* **CONTROLDAMPER**: Control damper used to automatically modulate the flow of air by adjusting the position of the blades.
* **FIREDAMPER**: Fire damper used to prevent the spread of fire for a specified duration.
* **SMOKEDAMPER**: Smoke damper used to prevent the spread of smoke.
* **FIRESMOKEDAMPER**: Combination fire and smoke damper used to preven the spread of fire and smoke.
* **BACKDRAFTDAMPER**: Backdraft damper used to restrict the movement of air in one direction.
* **RELIEFDAMPER**: Relief damper used to allow air to move upon a buildup of a specified pressure differential.
* **BLASTDAMPER**: Blast damper.
* **GRAVITYDAMPER**: Gravity damper closes from the force of gravity.
* **GRAVITYRELIEFDAMPER**: Gravity-relief damper used to allow air to move upon a buildup of enough pressure to overcome the gravitational force exerted upon the damper blades.
* **FUMEHOODEXHAUST**: Fume hood exhaust damper.
* **BALANCINGDAMPER**: Damper used for purposes of manually balancing pressure differences.
