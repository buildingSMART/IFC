Enumeration defining the typical types of fans. The _IfcFanTypeEnum_ contains the following:

* **CENTRIFUGALFORWARDCURVED**: Air flows through the impeller radially using blades that are forward curved.
* **CENTRIFUGALRADIAL**: Air flows through the impeller radially using blades that are uncurved or slightl forward curved.
* **CENTRIFUGALBACKWARDINCLINEDCURVED**: Air flows through the impeller radially using blades that are backward curved.
* **CENTRIFUGALAIRFOIL**: Air flows through the impeller radially using blades are airfoil shaped.
* **TUBEAXIAL**: Air flows through the impeller axially with reduced tip clearance and operating at higher tip speeds.
* **VANEAXIAL**: Air flows through the impeller axially with guide vanes and reduced running blade tip clearance.
* **PROPELLORAXIAL**: Air flows through the impeller axially and small hub-to-tip ratio impeller mounted in an orifice plate or inlet ring.
* **USERDEFINED**: User-defined fan type.
* **NOTDEFINED**: Undefined fan type.
