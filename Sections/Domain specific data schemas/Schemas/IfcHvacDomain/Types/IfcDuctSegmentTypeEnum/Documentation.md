This enumeration is used to identify the primary purpose of a duct segment. This is a very basic categorization mechanism to generically identify the duct segment type. Subcategories of duct segments are not enumerated. The _IfcDuctSegmentTypeEnum_ contains the following:

* **RIGIDSEGMENT**: A rigid segment is continuous linear segment of duct that cannot be deformed.
* **FLEXIBLESEGMENT**: A flexible segment is a continuous non-linear segment of duct that can be deformed and change the direction of flow.
* **USERDEFINED**: User-defined segment.
* **NOTDEFINED**: Undefined segment.
