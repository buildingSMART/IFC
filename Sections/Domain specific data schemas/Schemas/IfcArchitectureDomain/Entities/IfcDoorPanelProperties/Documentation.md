A door panel is normally a door leaf that opens to allow people or goods to pass. The parameters of the door panel define the geometrically relevant parameter of the panel,

The _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ are used to parametrically describe the shape and operation of door panels. The parametric definition can be added solely or additionally to the explicit shape representation of the door.

The _IfcDoorType_ can define doors consisting of more then one panel. In this case, one instance of _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ has to be included for each door panel. The _PanelPosition_ attribute, in conjunction with the _IfcDoorStyle.OperationType_ attribute, determines to which panel the _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ apply. The _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ are included in the list of properties , given by attribute _HasPropertySets_ of the _IfcDoorType_. More information about the door panel can be included in the same list of the _IfcDoorStyle_ using the _IfcPropertySet_ for dynamic extensions.

The _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ does not hold a geometric representation. However it defines parameters which can be used to create the shape of the door type(which is inserted by the _IfcDoor_ into the spatial context of the project) as shown in Figure 1.

The parameters of the _IfcDoorPanelProperties_ define a standard door panel, including (if given) a proportional width to define non-uniform double swing (or sliding, or folding) doors. The outer boundary of the panel is determined by the 'Profile' shape representation assigned to the _IfcDoor_, which inserts the _IfcDoorType_. It has to take the lining parameter into account as well.
