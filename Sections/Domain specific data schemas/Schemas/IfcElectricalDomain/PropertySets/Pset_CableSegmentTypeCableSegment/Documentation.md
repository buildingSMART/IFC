Electrical cable with a specific purpose to lead electric current within a circuit or any other electric construction. Includes all types of electric cables, mainly several electrical segments wrapped together, e.g. cable, tube, busbar. Note that the number of conductors within a cable is determined by an aggregation mechanism that aggregates the conductors within the cable.
