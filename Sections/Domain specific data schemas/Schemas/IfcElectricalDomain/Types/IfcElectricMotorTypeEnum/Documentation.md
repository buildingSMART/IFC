		<tr> 
		  <td>DC</td> 
		  <td>A motor using either generated or rectified D.C. power.</td> 
		  <td></td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>INDUCTION</td> 
		  <td>An alternating current motor in which the primary winding on one
			 member (usually the stator) is connected to the power source and a secondary
			 winding or a squirrel-cage secondary winding on the other member (usually the
			 rotor) carries the induced current. There is no physical electrical connection
			 to the secondary winding, its current is induced.</td> 
		  <td></td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>POLYPHASE</td> 
		  <td>A two or three-phase induction motor in which the windings, one for
			 each phase, are evenly divided by the same number of electrical degrees. </td> 
		  <td></td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>RELUCTANCESYNCHRONOUS</td> 
		  <td>A synchronous motor with a special rotor design which directly
			 lines the rotor up with the rotating magnetic field of the stator, allowing for
			 no slip under load. </td> 
		  <td></td> 
		</tr> 
		<tr> 
		  <td>SYNCHRONOUS</td> 
		  <td>A motor that operates at a constant speed up to full load. The
			 rotor speed is equal to the speed of the rotating magnetic field of the stator;
			 there is no slip.</td>
