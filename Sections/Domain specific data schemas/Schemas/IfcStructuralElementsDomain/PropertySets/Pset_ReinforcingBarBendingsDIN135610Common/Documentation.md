Properties expressing the bending information of non-prestressed reinforcing bars. The properties in this Pset are largely defined according to DIN 1356 Teil 10 with some minor omissions: the shape type X2 is not considered since it is better represented by the explicit shape geometry. It is presumed that a single standard for defining the bar bending is used throughout the project and that this standard is referenced from the IfcProject object through the IfcDocumentReference mechanism. Note: This bending standard is presumably to be replaced by the upcoming ISO 3766 standard.
