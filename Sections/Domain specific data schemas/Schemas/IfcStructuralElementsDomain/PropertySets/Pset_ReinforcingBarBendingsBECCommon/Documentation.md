Properties expressing the bending information of non-prestressed reinforcing bars. The properties in this Pset are defined according to the local Finnish BEC standard with minor adjustements (only bar bending information is included). The bending shape property definitions apply to both reinforcing bars (IfcReinforcingBar) and reinforcing meshes (IfcReinforcingMesh). It is presumed that a single standard for defining the bar bending is used throughout the project and that this standard is referenced from the IfcProject object through the IfcDocumentReference mechanism.
