Properties expressing the bending information of non-prestressed reinforcing bars. The properties in this Pset are largely defined according to ISO/CD 3766 with some minor changes in how the hooks are defined (explicit angle measures instead of coded parameters). It is presumed that a single standard for defining the bar bending is used throughout the project and that this standard is referenced from the IfcProject object through the IfcDocumentReference mechanism. Note: This standard is still under development and the Pset will be changed accordingly if so required.
