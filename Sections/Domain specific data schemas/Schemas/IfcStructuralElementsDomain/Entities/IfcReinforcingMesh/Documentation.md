Placement and representation are defined at the supertype _IfcElementComponent_.

The representation map of a mapped 'Outline' representation should contain a representation of type 'Curve3D' which holds an _IfcPolyline_.

The representation map of a mapped 'Body' representation should contain a representation of type 'AdvancedSweptSolid' which holds multiple _IfcSweptDiskSolid_ (including subtype _IfcSweptDiskSolidPolygonal_).
