**Geometry Use Definitions:**

The geometric representation of _IfcReinforcingElement_ is given by the _IfcProductDefinitionShape_, allowing multiple geometric representations. Included are:

**Local Placement**  
The use of local placement is defined at the supertype _IfcBuildingElementComponent_.

**Standard Geometric Representation**  
The use of Standard Geometric Representations is defined at the supertype _IfcBuildingElementComponent_. Further constraints on the geometric representation may be defined in subtypes.
