A tendon is a steel element such as a wire, cable, bar, rod, or strand used to impart prestress to concrete when the element is tensioned.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 6707-1: steel bar(s) or groups of bars, strands or wires given a tensile stress that produces a compressive stress in prestressed concrete or masonry.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; To be efficient, the cable follows the deck alignment and moves vertically up on the top of the piers and down in the middle of the span. Therefore the cable axis is defined relatively towards the deck alignment. The ShapeRepresentation should be 'AdvancedSweptSolid' geometry based on SectionedSolidHorizontal description including DistanceExpression, CircleProfileDef and AlignmentCurve, leading to a polyline describing the cable directrix.

{ .extDef}
> NOTE&nbsp; Regarding the Structural Analysis model, the cable has to be transformed into loads applied at each CartesianPoint defining the polyline.
