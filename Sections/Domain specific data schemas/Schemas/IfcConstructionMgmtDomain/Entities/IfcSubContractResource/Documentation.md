### Use Definition
An _IfcSubContractResource_ can be used in cost estimating and work planning without specifying the subcontractor. However, it can be associated with an actor fulfilling the subcontractor role when detailed work planning is performed. The type of subcontractor can also be identified in a construction crew resource.
