_IfcConstructionResource_ is an abstract generalization of the different resources used in construction projects, mainly labour, material, equipment and product resources, plus subcontracted resources and aggregations such as a crew resource.

A resource represents "use of something" and does not necessarily correspond to a single item such as a person or vehicle, but represents a pool of items having limited availability such as general labor or an equipment fleet. A resource can represent either a generic resource pool (not having any task assignment) or a task-specific resource allocation (having an _IfcTask_ assignment).

Declaration use definition

A root-level resource (specifically _IfcCrewResource_ or _IfcSubContractResource_) is declared within the project by _IfcRelDeclares_ where _RelatingContext_ refers to the single _IfcProject_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_, and other root-level objects within the project.

{ .use-head}
Assignment use definition

A resource may be assigned to an actor by _IfcRelAssignsToActor_ where _RelatingActor_ refers to an _IfcActor_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Such relationship indicates the actor responsible for allocating the resource such as partitioning into task-specific allocations, delegating to other actors, and/or scheduling over time. Note that this assignment does not indicate the person or organization performing the work; that is indicated by _IfcRelAssignsToResource_. The actor responsible for the resource may or may not be the same as any actor(s) performing work.

A resource may be assigned to a control by _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ where _RelatingProduct_ refers to an _IfcControl_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcWorkCalendar_ is assigned indicating availability of the resource, where such calendar is nested within a base calendar or an _IfcWorkPlan_ which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.

A resource may be assigned to a group by _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_ where _RelatingGroup_ refers to an _IfcGroup_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcAsset_ is assigned indicating the asset to be tracked, where such asset is nested within an _IfcInventory_ which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.

A resource may be assigned to a product by _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_ where _RelatingProduct_ refers to an _IfcProduct_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcElement_ subtype is assigned indicating the product to be constructed, where such product is connected to a spatial structure which in turn is aggregated within the _IfcProject_.

A resource may be assigned to a process by _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_ where _RelatingProcess_ refers to an _IfcProcess_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more _IfcConstructionResource_ or other objects. Most commonly an _IfcTask_ is assigned indicating the task to be performed by the resource, where such task is nested within a summary task which in turn is assigned to the _IfcProject_.

A resource may have assignments of other objects using _IfcRelAssignsToResource_ where _RelatingResource_ refers to the _IfcConstructionResource_ and _RelatedObjects_ refers to one or more objects such as _IfcActor_ or _IfcProduct_ subtypes. This relationship indicates specific objects assigned to fulfill resource usage.

Baseline use definition

A resource may have any number of baselines defined using the relationship _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ where _RelatingObject_ is the "current" resource and _RelatedObjects_ consists of multiple "baseline" resources, each representing a copy of the resource as it existed at an earlier point in time as shown in Figure 185. Each baseline _IfcConstructionResource_ is identified by its nested _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship to an _IfcWorkSchedule_ having _PredefinedType=BASELINE_, _IfcWorkSchedule.CreationDate_ indicating the date of the baseline, and _IfcWorkSchedule.Name_ indicating the name of the baseline.
