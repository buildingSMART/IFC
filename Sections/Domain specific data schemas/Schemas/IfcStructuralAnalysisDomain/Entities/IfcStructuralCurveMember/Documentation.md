****Coordinate Systems****:

See definitions at _IfcStructuralItem_. The local coordinate system is established by the reference curve given by topology representation and by the attribute _Axis_. The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the reference curve. The local z axis is located in the surface which is created by sweeping _Axis_ along the reference curve and is directed according to _Axis_. The local y axis is directed such that x,y,z form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.
