The entity _IfcRelConnectsWithEccentricity_ adds the definition of eccentricity to the connection between a structural member and a structural connection (representing either a node or support).

> NOTE&nbsp; Another eccentricity model is available independently of eccentric connection specification: The section profile of a curve member may be inserted eccentrically with respect to the member's reference curve, see definitions at _IfcStructuralCurveMember_. Whether one or the other or both eccentricity models may be used is subject to information requirements and local agreements.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x3.
