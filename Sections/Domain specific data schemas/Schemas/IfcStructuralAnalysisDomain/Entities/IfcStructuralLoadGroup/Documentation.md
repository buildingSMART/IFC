The entity _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ is used to structure the physical impacts. By using the grouping features inherited from _IfcGroup_, instances of _IfcStructuralAction_ (or its subclasses) and of _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ can be used to define load groups, load cases and load combinations. (See also _IfcLoadGroupTypeEnum_.)

> NOTE&nbsp; Important functionality for the description of a load-bearing system is derived from the existing IFC entity _IfcGroup_. This class provides, via the relationship class _IfcRelAssignsToGroup_, the needed grouping mechanism. In this way, instances of _IfcStructuralAction_ belonging to a specific load group can be unambiguously determined.

> NOTE&nbsp; The relationship class _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_ is used to group load cases into load combinations. The factor provided in this assignment relationship is to applied together with the optional _IfcStructuralLoadGroup.Coefficient_. Unlike this coefficient which always affects the load group, the _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor.Factor_ is specific for a load case&mdash;load combination pair. As many instances of _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_ are used within one load combination as there are different _Factor_s to be applied to load cases in the load combination. On the other hand, a load case may appear in more than one load combination and can have a different _Factor_ in each assignment by _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc4}
> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Subtype _IfcStructuralLoadCase_ added. Informal propositions and WHERE rule added. Predefined type LOAD_COMBINATION_GROUP made obsolete and removed.

{ .spec-head}
Informal Propositions:

1. Load groups of type LOAD_GROUP shall only contain instances of _IfcStructuralAction_.
2. Load groups of type LOAD_CASE shall always be instantiated from the subtype _IfcStructuralLoadCase_, not directly from the generic type _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ itself.
3. Instances of _IfcStructuralLoadCase_ shall only contain instances of _IfcStructuralAction_ or/ and instances of _IfcStructuralLoadGroup_ of type LOAD_GROUP.
4. Load groups of type LOAD_COMBINATION shall only contain instances of _IfcStructuralLoadCase_.
