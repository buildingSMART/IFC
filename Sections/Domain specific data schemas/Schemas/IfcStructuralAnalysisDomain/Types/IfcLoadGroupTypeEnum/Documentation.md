This enumeration is used to distinguish between different levels of load grouping. It allows to differentiate between load groups, load cases, and load combinations.

> HISTORY&nbsp; New enumeration in IFC2x2.

{ .change-ifc2x4}
> IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; LOAD_COMBINATION_GROUP deprecated. Load cases are directly assigned to load combinations with different factors for each load case&mdash;load combination pair by means of _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_.

Enumerated Item Definitions:

* **LOAD_GROUP**: groups instances of subtypes of _IfcStructuralAction_. It shall be used as a container for loads grouped together for specific purposes, such as loads which are part of a special load pattern.
* **LOAD_CASE**: groups LOAD_GROUPs and instances of subtypes of _IfcStructuralAction_. It should be used as a container for loads with the same origin.
* **LOAD_COMBINATION_GROUP**: an intermediate level between LOAD_CASE and LOAD_COMBINATION. This level is obsolete and deprecated. Before the introduction of _IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor_, the purpose of this level was to provide a factor with which one or more LOAD_CASEs occur in a LOAD_COMBINATION. 
* **LOAD_COMBINATION**: used to group load cases which act together into a load combination.
* **USERDEFINED**: A grouping level which does not follow the standard hierarchy of load group types.
* **NOTDEFINED**: The grouping level is not yet known.
