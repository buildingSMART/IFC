* **BENDING_ELEMENT**: A member with capacity to carry out-of-plane loads, i.e. a plate.
* **MEMBRANE_ELEMENT**: A member with capacity to carry in-plane loads, for example a shear wall.
* **SHELL**: A member with capacity to carry in-plane and out-of-plane loads, i.e. a combination of bending element and membrane element.
* **USERDEFINED**: A specially defined member.
