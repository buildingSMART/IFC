The following are within the entire scope of this release of IFC:

{ .std}
    * BIM exchange format definitions that are required during the life cycle phases of buildings: 
        * demonstrating the need;
        * conception of need;
        * outline feasibility;
        * substantive feasibility study and outline financial authority;
        * outline conceptual design;
        * full conceptual design;
        * coordinated design;
        * procurement and full financial authority;
        * production information;
        * construction;
        * operation and maintenance. 
    * BIM exchange format definitions that are required by the various disciplines involved within the life cycle phases: 
        * architecture;
        * building service;
        * structural engineering;
        * procurement;
        * construction planning;
        * facility management;
        * project management;
        * client requirement management;
        * building authority for permits and approval. 
    * BIM exchange format definitions including: 
        * project structure;
        * physical components;
        * spatial components;
        * analysis items;
        * processes;
        * resources;
        * controls;
        * actors;
        * context definition. 

    * exchange format definitions outside of the domain of construction and facility maintenance; 
    * full project structure and component breakdown structures outside of building engineering, but providing a baseline for civil engineering to be extended in future releases; 
    * behavioral aspects of components and other information items.
