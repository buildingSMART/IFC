An _IfcCostItem_ can nest other instances of _IfcCostItem_ through its relationships to _IfcRelNests_. This can be used to enable the development of complex groups of costs as may be found in cost schedules through to pages, sections and complete cost schedules.

There is always a summary cost item as the root item of the tree representing the cost item nesting. Subsequent instances of _IfcCostItem_ are assigned to the summary cost item using _IfcRelNests_. The summary cost item itself is assigned to _IfcCostSchedule_ through the _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship.

Figure 1 illustrates a cost item composition used for a cost schedule. Each line item has a quantity and separate unit costs where _IfcCostValue.CostType_ indicates the category of cost. The summary item has a hierarchy of costs calculated according to _IfcAppliedValueRelationship.ArithmeticOperator_, where _IfcCostValue.CostType_ identifies the category to be totalled. The Tax component has _IfcCostValue.CostType_ set to 'Material' which indicates it is the sum of all nested values of the 'Material' category ($3 x 3000 + $118 x 100 = $20800). The Subtotal component has _IfcCostValue.CostType_ set to an asterisk ('\*') which indicates it is the sum of all nested values of all categories.
