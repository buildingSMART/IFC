This represents the 3D flow path of the item having _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType_ of 'Curve3D' and containing a single _IfcBoundedCurve_ subtype such as _IfcPolyline_, _IfcTrimmedCurve_, or _IfcCompositeCurve_. For elements containing directional ports (_IfcDistributionPort_ with _FlowDirection_ of _SOURCE_ or _SINK_), the direction of the curve indicates direction of flow where a _SINK_ port is positioned at the start of the curve and a _SOURCE_ port is positioned at the end of the curve. This representation is most applicable to flow segments (pipes, ducts, cables), however may be used at other elements to define a primary flow path if applicable.
