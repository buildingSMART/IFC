The relationship _IfcRelSequence_ is used to indicate control flow. An _IfcEvent_ as a predecessor (_IfcRelSequence.RelatingProcess_) indicates that the succeeding process (typically _IfcProcedure_ or _IfcTask_) is triggered in response to the event. An _IfcEvent_ as a successor (_IfcRelSequence.RelatedProcess_) indicates that the completion of the preceeding process causes the event to be triggered. As events have zero duration, the _IfcRelSequence.SequenceType_ attribute has no effect on an _IfcEvent_ but still applies to the opposite end of the relationship if _IfcTask_ is used.
