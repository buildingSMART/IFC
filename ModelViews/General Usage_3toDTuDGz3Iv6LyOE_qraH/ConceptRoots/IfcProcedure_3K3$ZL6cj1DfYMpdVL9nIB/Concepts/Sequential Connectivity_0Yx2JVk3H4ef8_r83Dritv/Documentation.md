The relationship _IfcRelSequence_ is used to indicate control flow. An _IfcProcedure_ as a successor to an _IfcEvent_ indicates that the procedure should be performed in response to the event. An _IfcProcedure_ as a predecessor to an _IfcEvent_ indicates that the event should be trigerred following the procedure. As procedures have arbitrary duration, the _IfcRelSequence.SequenceType_ attribute has no effect on an _IfcProcedure_ but still applies to the opposite end of the relationship if _IfcTask_ is used.
