The material information of the _IfcSlab_ is defined by _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcSlabType_. In this case, the material information does not allow to construct a shape by applying the layer definition to the plane of the shape representation, to enable this parametric definition, the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ has to be used instead.
