The body representation of _IfcSite_ is defined using a solid or surface model. Applicable solids are the _IfcFacetedBrep_ or on the _IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids_, applicable surface models are the _IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel_ and the _IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel_.

The representation identifier and type of this representation of _IfcSite_ is:

* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationIdentifier_ = 'Body'
* _IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType_ = 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel'
