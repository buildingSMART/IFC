The material of the _IfcWall_ is defined by _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcWallType_.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to assign an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ to an _IfcWall_. Only the subtype _IfcWallStandardCase_ supports this concept.
