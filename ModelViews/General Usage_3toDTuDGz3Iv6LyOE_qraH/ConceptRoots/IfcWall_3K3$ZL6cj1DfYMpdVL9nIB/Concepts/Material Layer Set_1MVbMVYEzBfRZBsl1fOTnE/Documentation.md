The material information of the _IfcWall_ is defined by _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcWallType_. In this case, the material information does not allow to construct a shape by applying the layer definition to the axis representation, to enable this parametric definition, the _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ has to be used instead.
