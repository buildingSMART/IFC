The resource type may provide shared productivity and cost information, allowing tasks and resources to be selected according to lowest cost and/or shortest duration. Given an _IfcProduct_ of a particular _IfcTypeProduct_ type, an _IfcTypeProcess_ may be selected from those assigned to the product type using _IfcRelAssignsToProduct_, and an _IfcTypeResource_ may be selected from those assigned to the process type using _IfcRelAssignsToProcess_. Then _IfcTask_ and _IfcConstructionResource_ occurrences may be instantiated from the type definitions, applying productivitity and rate information to assigned quantities to calculate _ResourceTime.ScheduleWork_. Task durations can then be calculated by dividing _ResourceTime.ScheduleWork_ by _ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage_.
