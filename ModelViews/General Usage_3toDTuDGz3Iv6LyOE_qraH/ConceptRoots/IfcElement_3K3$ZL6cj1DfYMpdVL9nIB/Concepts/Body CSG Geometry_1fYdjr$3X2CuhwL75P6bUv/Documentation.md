Any _IfcElement_ (so far no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented a CSG primitive or CSG tree. The CSG representation allows for the representation of complex element shape.

> NOTE&nbsp; View definitions or implementer agreements may restrict or disallow the use of 'CSG' geometry.
