The local placement for _IfcGrid_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point (if given) to the local placement of the same _IfcSpatialStructureElement_, which is used in the _ContainedInStructure_ inverse attribute, or to a spatial structure element at a higher level, referenced by that. 
* If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
