_IfcTransportElement_ defines the occuurence of any transportation device, common information about transportation device types (or styles) is handled by _IfcTransportElementType_. The _IfcTransportElementType_ (if present) may establish the common&nbsp;type name, usage (or predefined) type, common material layer set, common set of properties and common shape representations (using _IfcRepresentationMap_). The _IfcTransportElementType_ is attached using the _IfcRelDefinedByType.RelatingType_ objectified relationship and is accessible by the inverse _<font color="#0000FF">IsTypedBy</font>_ attribute.

If no _IfcTransportElementType_ is attached&nbsp;(i.e. if only occurrence information is given) the _PredefinedType_ should be provided. If set to .USERDEFINED. a user defined value can be provided by the _ObjectType_ attribute.
