The door profile is represented by a three-dimensional closed curve within a particular shape representation. The profile is used to apply the parameter of the parametric door representation. Only a single closed curve shall be contained in the set of _IfcShapeRepresentation.Items_.

A 'Profile' representation has to be provided if a parametric representation is applied to the door.
