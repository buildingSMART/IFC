> NOTE&nbsp; By using the inverse relationship _IfcBuilding.Decomposes_ it references _IfcProject_ || _IfcSite_ || _IfcBuilding_ through _IfcRelAggregates.RelatingObject_. If it refers to another instance of _IfcBuilding_, the referenced _IfcBuilding_ needs to have a different and higher _CompositionType_, i.e. COMPLEX (if the other _IfcBuilding_ has ELEMENT), or ELEMENT (if the other _IfcBuilding_ has PARTIAL).
