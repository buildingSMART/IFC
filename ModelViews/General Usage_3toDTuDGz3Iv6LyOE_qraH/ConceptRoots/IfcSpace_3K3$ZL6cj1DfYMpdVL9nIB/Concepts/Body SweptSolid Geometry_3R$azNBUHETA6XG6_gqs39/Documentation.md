The following constraints apply to the standard representation:

* **Solid**: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_ is required,
* **Profile**: _IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef_ is required, _IfcArbitraryProfileDefWithVoids_ shall be supported.
* **Extrusion**: The extrusion direction shall be vertically, i.e., along the positive Z Axis of the co-ordinate system of the containing spatial structure element.

Figure 1 shows an extrusion of an arbitrary profile definition with voids into the swept area solid of _IfcSpace_.
