The foot print representation of _IfcBuildingStorey_ is given by either a single 2D curve (such as _IfcPolyline_ or _IfcCompositeCurve_), or by a list of 2D curves (in case of inner boundaries), if the building storey has an independent geometric representation.

> NOTE&nbsp; The independent geometric representation of _IfcBuildingStorey_ may not be allowed in certain model view definitions. In those cases only the contained elements and spaces have an independent geometric representation.
