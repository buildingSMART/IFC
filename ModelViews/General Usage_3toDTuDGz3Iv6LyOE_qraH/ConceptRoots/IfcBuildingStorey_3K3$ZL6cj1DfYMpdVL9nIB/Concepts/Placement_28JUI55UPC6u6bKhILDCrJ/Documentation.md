The local placement for _IfcBuildingStorey_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point (if relative placement is used) to the _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ of type _IfcBuilding_, or of type _IfcBuildingStorey_ (e.g. to position a building storey relative to a building storey complex, or a partial building storey to a building storey).
* If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
