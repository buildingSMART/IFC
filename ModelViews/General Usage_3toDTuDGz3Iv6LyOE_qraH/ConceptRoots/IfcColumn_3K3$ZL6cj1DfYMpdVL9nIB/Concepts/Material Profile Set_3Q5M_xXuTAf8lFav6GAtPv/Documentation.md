The material of the _IfcColumn_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcColumnType_.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to assign an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ to an _IfcColumn_. Only the subtype _IfcColumnStandardCase_ supports this concept.
