The material information of the _IfcMember_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcMemberType_. In this case, the material information does not allow to construct a shape by applying the profile definition to the axis representation, to enable this parametric definition, the _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ has to be used instead.
