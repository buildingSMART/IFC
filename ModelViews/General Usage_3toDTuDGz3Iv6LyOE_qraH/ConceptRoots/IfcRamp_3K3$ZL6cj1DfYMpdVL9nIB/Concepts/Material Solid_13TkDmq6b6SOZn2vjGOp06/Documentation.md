The material of the _IfcRamp_ is defined by the _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

Material information can also be given at the _IfcRampType_, defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type.Â It is then accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ relationship pointing to _IfcRampType.HasAssociations_ and via _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_ to _IfcMaterial_. If both are given, then the material directly assigned to _IfcRamp_ overrides the material assigned to _IfcRampType_.
