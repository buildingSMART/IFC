The base calendar of a work calendar is defined by _IfcRelAssignsToControl_, where _IfcRelAssignsToControl.RelatingControl_ is linked with the base calendar and _IfcRelAssignsToControl.RelatedObjects_ is linked with work calendars that are derived from the base calendar. Although not restricted by the _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship it is only allowed to have one base calendar.
