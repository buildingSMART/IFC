The material of the _IfcBeam_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcBeamType_.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to assign an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ to an _IfcBeam_. Only the subtype _IfcBeamStandardCase_ supports this concept.
