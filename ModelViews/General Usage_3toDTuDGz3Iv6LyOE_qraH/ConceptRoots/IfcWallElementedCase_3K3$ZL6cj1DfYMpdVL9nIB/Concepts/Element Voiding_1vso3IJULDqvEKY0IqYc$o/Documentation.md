As shown in Figure 1, openings within the composite wall are directly assigned to _IfcWallElementedCase_ using _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcOpeningElement_ and apply to all aggregated parts. If individual parts have cutting and other voiding features, then the decomposed parts have a separate voiding relationship _IfcRelVoidsElement_ pointing to _IfcVoidingFeature_.
