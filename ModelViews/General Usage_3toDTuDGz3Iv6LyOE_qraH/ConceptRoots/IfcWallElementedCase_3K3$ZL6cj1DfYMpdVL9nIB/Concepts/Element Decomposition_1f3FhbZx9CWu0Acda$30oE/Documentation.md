An elemented wall is decomposed into parts for particular components such as framing and panels on each side. There must be an object corresponding to each type of part, however there may be single object instance indicating multiple placements (via mapping geometry) for each part, or multiple instances corresponding to each placement. For minimizing file size, it is recommended to use a single object with multiple placement unless there are specific connectivity relationships indicated (e.g. a junction box connected to a specific stud).
