			<Documentation>Indicates the property to be occupied. Particular details of the agreement relating to the occupancy of a property are dealt within the _Pset_PropertyAgreement_ that is defined for the instance of _IfcSpatialStructureElement_. This means that an occupant may be related to a site, building, building storey or space through the _IfcSpatialStructureElement.ElementComposition_ attribute. For instance, if the property concerned is several office spaces on a building storey, it might be appropriate to reference _IfcBuildingStorey.ElementComposition=PARTIAL_.  Occupants of a property may be considered to be the parties to an agreement. The roles that the occupant may play in respect to an agreement are defined in the _IfcOccupantTypeEnum_ enumeration. If the role is not specified by the predefined contents of this enumeration, the value _USERDEFINED_ may be set and the _ObjectType_ attribute asserted.</Documentation>
