### Purpose of the Reference View
The main purpose of this document is to define a standardized subset of the IFC4 schema, a Model View Definition MVD, that is particularly suitable for all BIM workflows in bridge projects that are based on reference models, where the exchange is mainly one-directional. Here requested modifications of the BIM data, mainly of the shape representation, are handled by a change request to the original author, and changes are not executed upon the imported IFC data with the intent to be sent back to the original source.

The Bridge Reference View inherits all definitions from Reference View adding only bridge specific deifnitions. It does not feature any alignment based product shape definitions i.e. placements and geometric representations. Product shape is in Cartesian coordinates.
