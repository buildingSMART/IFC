The material of the _IfcBeamType_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

> NOTE&nbsp; The attribute _ProfileName_ of the _IfcProfileDef_ subtype, referenced in _IfcMaterialProfile_ should contain a standardized profile name according to local standards. However, an additional geometric representation of the profile is necessary (such as _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_). An importing application is allowed to check for the existence of the profile name: in case of identifying it as a standardized name, the corresponding profile geometry and possibly other cross sectional properties can be read from a library. Otherwise the geometric representation and possible non geometric _IfcProfileProperties_ have to be used.
