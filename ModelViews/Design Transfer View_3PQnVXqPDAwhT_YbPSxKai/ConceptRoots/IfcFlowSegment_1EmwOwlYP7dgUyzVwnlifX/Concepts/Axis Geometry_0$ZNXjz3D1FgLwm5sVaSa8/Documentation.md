Standard representations are defined at the supertype _IfcDistributionFlowElement_. For parametric flow segments where [IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage](../../ifcmaterialresource/lexical/ifcmaterialprofilesetusage.htm) is defined and an 'Axis' representation is defined, then the 'Body' representation may be generated using the 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' representation types by sweeping the profile(s) along the axis.
