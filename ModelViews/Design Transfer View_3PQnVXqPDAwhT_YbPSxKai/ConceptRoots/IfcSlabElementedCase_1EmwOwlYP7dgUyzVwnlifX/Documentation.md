Elemented slabs extend the concepts of standard slabs with the following features, as shown in Figure 234:

* The slab has a type (_IfcSlabType_) that indicates material layers and corresponding elements to be placed parametrically.
* The slab is decomposed into elements for part occurrences, each corresponding to parts defined at the slab type.
* The relationship _IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements_ indicates how parts are connected.
