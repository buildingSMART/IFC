The material of the _IfcWallType_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ or as fall back by _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

The shared material layer set definition is defined by assigning an _IfcMaterialLayerSet_ (see material use definition above). The _IfcMaterialLayer_ refers to one or several of _IfcMaterialLayer_ that is the common for all wall occurrence, if used.

If a wall type is decomposed into parts, then material layers of the _IfcWallType_ may be driven by corresponding material layers and profiles of components, where _IfcMaterialLayer_.Name refers to _IfcElement_.Name. The ordering of layers is preserved by the layer set, while the thicknesses of each layer are calculated according to the material layer/profile geometry of the parts.
