The cross-section and materials of a port may be indicated using _IfcMaterialProfileSet_. The material profile may indicate the connection and optionally the flow substance if applicable. If provided, for a port to be able to connect to another port on another object, applications may require asserted attributes of material profiles to be identical. For example, the port for a pipe connection may indicate a circular profile of a nominal diameter, particular piping material such as copper, and an optional flow substance such as water, where properties may be indicated on such materials indicating flow characteristics.
