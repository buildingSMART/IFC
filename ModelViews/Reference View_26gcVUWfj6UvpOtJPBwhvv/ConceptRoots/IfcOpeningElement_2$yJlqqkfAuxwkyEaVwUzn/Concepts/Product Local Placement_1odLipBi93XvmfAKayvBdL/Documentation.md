Placement of elements is defined by a local placement (a transformation matrix relative to):

* the element that is voided (if it is an aggregated part) 
    * provided by the relationship _VoidsElement_._RelatingBuildingElement_
    * being a subtype of _IfcElement_ 

The local placement shall always be relative.
