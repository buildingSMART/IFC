The material of the _IfcSlab_ is defined by _IfcMaterialLayerSet_, or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcSlabType_.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to assign an _IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage_ to an _IfcSlab_. Only the subtype _IfcSlabStandardCase_ supports this concept.
