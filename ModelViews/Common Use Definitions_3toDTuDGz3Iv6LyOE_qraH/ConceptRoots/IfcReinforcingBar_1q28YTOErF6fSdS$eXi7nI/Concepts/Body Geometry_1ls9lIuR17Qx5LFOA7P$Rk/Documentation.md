The representation map referenced by a 'Body' 'MappedRepresentation' should contain a representation of type 'AdvancedSweptSolid' which holds an _IfcSweptDiskSolid_ (including subtype _IfcSweptDiskSolidPolygonal_). Multiple _IfcMappedItem_'s can be used to represent several bars as one occurrence of _IfcReinforcingBar_.
