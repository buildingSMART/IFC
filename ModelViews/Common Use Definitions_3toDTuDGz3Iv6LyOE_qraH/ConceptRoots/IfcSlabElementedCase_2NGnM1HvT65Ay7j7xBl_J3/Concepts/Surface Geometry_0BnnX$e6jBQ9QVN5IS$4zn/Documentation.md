A three-dimensional surface being a subtype of _IfcBoundedSurface_ defining the reference surface for the elemented slab. It maybe used as a simplified representation directly at the elemented slab.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is invalid to exhange a 'Body' shape representation of an _IfcSlabElementedCase_. The body geometry is defined by the parts within the decomposition.

> NOTE&nbsp; The 'Surface' can be used to define a surfacic model of the building (e.g. for analytical purposes, or for reduced Level of Detail representation). It should suppress the geometric details of the parts in the decomposition.
