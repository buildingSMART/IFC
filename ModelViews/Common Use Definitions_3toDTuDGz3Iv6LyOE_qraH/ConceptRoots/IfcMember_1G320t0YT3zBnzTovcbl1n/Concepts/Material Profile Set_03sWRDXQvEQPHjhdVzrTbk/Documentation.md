The material of the _IfcMember_ is defined by the _IfcMaterialProfileSet_ or as fallback by _IfcMaterial_, and it is attached either directly or at the _IfcMemberType_.

> NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to assign an _IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage_ to an _IfcMember_. Only the subtype _IfcMemberStandardCase_ supports this concept.
