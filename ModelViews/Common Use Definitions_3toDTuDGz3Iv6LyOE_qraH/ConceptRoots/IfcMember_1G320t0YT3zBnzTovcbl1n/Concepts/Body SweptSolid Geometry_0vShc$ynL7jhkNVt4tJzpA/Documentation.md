The following additional constraints apply to the 'SweptSolid' representation:

* **Solid**: _IfcExtrudedAreaSolid_, _IfcRevolvedAreaSolid_ shall be supported
* **Profile**: all subtypes of _IfcProfileDef_ (with exception of _IfcArbitraryOpenProfileDef_)Â 
* **Extrusion**: All extrusion directions shall be supported.

Figure 1 illustrates a 'SweptSolid' geometric representation. There are no restrictions or conventions on how to use the local placement (black), solid of extrusion placement (red) and profile placement (green).
