The _IfcDistributionElement_ may participate in two different containment relationships. The first (and in most implementation scenarios mandatory) relationship is the hierachical spatial containment, the second (optional) relationship is the aggregation within an&nbsp;element assembly.

* The _IfcDistributionElement_ is places within the project spatial hierarchy using the objectified relationship _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_, referring to it by its inverse attribute _SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_. Subtypes of&nbsp;_IfcSpatialStructureElement_ are valid spatial containers, with _IfcSpace_ being the default container. 
* The _IfcDistributionElement_ may be aggregated into an element assembly using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_, referring to it by its inverse attribute _SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes_. Any subtype of _IfcElement_ can be an element assembly, with _IfcElementAssembly_ as a special focus subtype. In this case it should not be additionally contained in the project spatial hierarchy, i.e.&nbsp;_SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure_ should be _NIL._
