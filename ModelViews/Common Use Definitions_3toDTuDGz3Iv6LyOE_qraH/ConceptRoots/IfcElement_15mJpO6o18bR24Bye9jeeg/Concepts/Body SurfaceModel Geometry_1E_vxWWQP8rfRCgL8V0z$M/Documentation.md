Any _IfcElement_ (so far no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented as a single or multiple surface models, based on either shell or face based surface models. It may also include tessellated models.

by an <em>IfcShapeRepresentation</em>, which includes a single item which is either an <em>IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel</em>, or an <em>IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel</em>. In some cases it may also be useful to expose a simple 
representation as a bounding box representation of the same complex 
shape.</blockquote></td>
