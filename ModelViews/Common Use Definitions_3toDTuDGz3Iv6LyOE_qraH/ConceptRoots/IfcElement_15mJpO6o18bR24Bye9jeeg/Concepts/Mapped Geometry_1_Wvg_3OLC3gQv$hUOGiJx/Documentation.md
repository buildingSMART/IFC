Any _IfcElement_ (so far no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes) may be represented using the 'MappedRepresentation'. This shall be supported as it allows for reusing the geometry definition of a type at all occurrences of the same type. The results are more compact data sets.

The same constraints, as given for 'SurfaceOrSolidModel', 'SurfaceModel', 'Tessellation', 'Brep', and 'AdvancedBrep' geometric representation, shall apply to the _IfcRepresentationMap_.
