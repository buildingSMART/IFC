_IfcTaskType_ may nest other _IfcTaskType_ or _IfcTask_ entities using the _IfcRelNests_ relationship. Such nesting indicates decomposed level of detail. Nesting of _IfcTask_ entities is used if a task type shall be detailed by a sequence of tasks or if there is a need to include additional time information such as the duration of subtasks. Please note that _IfcTask_ entities being contained within an _IfcTaskType_ are linked with their task occurrences via _IfcRelDefinesByObject_ relationships. It is also possible to define a task type for these _IfcTask_ entities via _IfcRelDefinesByType_ relationships. For further information please see the documentation of _IfcRelDefinesByObject_.
