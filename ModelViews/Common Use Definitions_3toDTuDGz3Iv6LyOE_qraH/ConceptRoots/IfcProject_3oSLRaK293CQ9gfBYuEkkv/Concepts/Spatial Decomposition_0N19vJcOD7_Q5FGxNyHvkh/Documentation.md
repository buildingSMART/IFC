The _IfcProject_ is used to reference the root of the spatial structure of a building or other construction project (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together, and to the _IfcProject_, by using the objectified relationship _IfcRelAggregates_.
