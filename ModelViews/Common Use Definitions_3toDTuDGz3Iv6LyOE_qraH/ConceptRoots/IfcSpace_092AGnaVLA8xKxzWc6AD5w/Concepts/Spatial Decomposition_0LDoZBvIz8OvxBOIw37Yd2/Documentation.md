By using the inverse relationship _IfcSpace.Decomposes_ it references _IfcSite_ || _IfcBuildingStorey_ || _IfcSpace_ by _IfcRelAggregates.RelatingObject_. If it refers to another instance of _IfcSpace_, the referenced _IfcSpace_ needs to have a different and higher _CompositionType_, i.e. COMPLEX (if the other _IfcSpace_ has ELEMENT), or ELEMENT (if the other _IfcSpace_ has PARTIAL).
