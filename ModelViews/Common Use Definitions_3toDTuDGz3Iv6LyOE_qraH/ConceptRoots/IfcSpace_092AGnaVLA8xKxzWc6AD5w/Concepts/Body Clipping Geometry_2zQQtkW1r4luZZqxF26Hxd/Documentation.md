The following additional constraints apply to the advanced representation:

* **Solid**: see standard geometric representation,
* **Profile**: see standard geometric representation,
* **Extrusion**: see standard geometric representation,
* **Boolean result**: The difference operation with the second operand being of type _IfcHalfSpaceSolid_ (or one of its subtypes) shall be supported.

Figure 1 shows an extrusion of an arbitrary profile definition into the swept area solid. The solid and an half space solid are operands of the Boolean result of _IfcSpace_.
