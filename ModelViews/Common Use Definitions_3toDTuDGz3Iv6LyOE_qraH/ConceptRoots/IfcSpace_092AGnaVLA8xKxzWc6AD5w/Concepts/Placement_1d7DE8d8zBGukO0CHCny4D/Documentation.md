The local placement for _IfcSpace_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point to the local placement of the _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ of type "IfcBuildingStorey", if relative placement is used, or of type "IfcSpace" (e.g. to position a space relative to a space group, or a partial space to a space).
* If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system.
