From IFC4 onwards the assignment of tasks to the work control is handled by the _IfcRelAssignsToControl_ relationship. _IfcRelAssignsTasks_ as used in previous IFC releases has been deleted and can not be used any longer. Another change in IFC4 is that it is not necessary to assign each task to a work control as it is regarded to be sufficient if the summary task (root task in the task hierarchy defined through _IfcRelNests_ relationships) is assigned to a work control.
