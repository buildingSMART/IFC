The _IfcRampFlight_, as any subtype of _IfcBuildingElement_, may participate alternatively in one of the two different containment relationships:

* the _Spatial Containment_ (defined here), or
* the _Element Composition_.

> NOTE&nbsp; Model view definitions or implementer agreements may force an _IfcRampFlight_ to be solely used as a part within an _IfcRamp_ container. In this case, no _Spatial containment_ shall be used.
