The local placement for _IfcSite_ is defined in its supertype _IfcProduct_. It is defined by the _IfcLocalPlacement_, which defines the local coordinate system that is referenced by all geometric representations.

* The _PlacementRelTo_ relationship of _IfcLocalPlacement_ shall point to the _IfcSpatialStructureElement_ of type "_IfcSite_", if relative placement is used (e.g. to position a site relative a a site complex, or a site section to a site).
* If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system. If there is only one site object, then this is the default situation.
