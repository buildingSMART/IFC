Constraints may be applied to a task to indicate fixed task duration, fixed start or fixed finish (see Figure 147). The relationship _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint_ is used where _RelatingConstraint_ points to an _IfcMetric_ and _RelatedObjects_ includes the _IfcTask_. _IfcRelAssociatesConstraint.Name_ identifies the attribute to be constrained using a period (".") to dereference; for example, "TaskTime.ScheduleStart" refers to the _ScheduleStart_ attribute on the _IfcTaskTime_ entity referenced on the _TaskTime_ attribute. The following attributes may be constrained (see Table 11 with Constrained Attribute):

*  **'TaskTime.ScheduleDuration'**: Indicate fixed duration of task with ConstraintGrade=HARD and Benchmark=EQUALTO such that changes to an assigned _IfcConstructionResource.ResourceTime.ScheduleWork_ should impact _IfcConstructionResource.ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage_, and vice-versa. 
*  **'TaskTime.ScheduleStart'**: Indicate constrained start date with ConstraintGrade=HARD and Benchmark of EQUALTO, GREATERTHANOREQUALTO, or LESSTHANOREQUALTO to indicate "must start on", "start no earlier than" or "start no later than" respectively where _IfcMetric.DataValue_ indicates the specific _IfcDateTime_. Use SOFT constraint having LESSTHAN benchmark to indicate "start as soon as possible". 
*  **'TaskTime.ScheduleFinish'**: Indicate constrained finish date with ConstraintGrade=HARD and Benchmark of EQUALTO, GREATERTHANOREQUALTO, or LESSTHANOREQUALTO to indicate "must finish on", "finish no earlier than" or "finish no later than" respectively where _IfcMetric.DateValue_ indicates the specific _IfcDateTime_. Use SOFT constraint having GREATERTHAN benchmark to indicate "finish as late as possible". 

A "manual scheduled task" is indicated with ConstraintGrade=HARD and Benchmark=EQUALTO for both _TaskTime.ScheduleStart_ and _TaskTime.ScheduleFinish_.
