Documents may be published for work plans consisting of schedules, calendars, tasks, and resources. The relationship _IfcRelAssociatesDocument_ may be used to preserve mappings to such document where _RelatingDocument_ points to an _IfcDocumentReference_ and _RelatedObjects_ includes the _IfcConstructionResource_ as shown in Figure 184. _IfcDocumentReference.ItemReference_ identifies the resource within the scope of the document, such as an integer or guid. The _IfcDocumentReference.ReferencedDocument_ corresponds to the document which is uniquely identified by _IfcDocumentInformation.DocumentId_ and/or _IfcDocumentInformation.PublicationLocation_. Such document mapping allows items in the document to be updated from the building information model and vice-versa.
