The material of the _IfcStair_ is defined by the _IfcMaterial_ and attached by the _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial_._RelatingMaterial_. It is accessible by the inverse _HasAssociations_ relationship.

Material information can also be given at the _IfcStairType_, defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type. It is then accessible by the inverse _IsDefinedBy_ relationship pointing to _IfcStair.HasAssociations_ and via _IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial_ to _IfcMaterial_. If both are given, then the material directly assigned to _IfcStair_ overrides the material assigned to _IfcStairType_.
