The walking line is represented by a two-dimensional open curve as the axis. The curve is directed into the upward direction (direction has to be interpreted as specified at the subtypes of _IfcCurve_).

> NOTE&nbsp; The 'Axis' representation of _IfcStair_ may be provided even if the _IfcStair_ has components with own shape representations.
