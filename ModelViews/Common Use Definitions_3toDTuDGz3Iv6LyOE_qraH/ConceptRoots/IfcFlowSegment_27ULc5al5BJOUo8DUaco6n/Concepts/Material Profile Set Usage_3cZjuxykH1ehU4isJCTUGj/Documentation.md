The material of the **IfcFlowSegment** is defined using one of the following entities:

* [IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage](../../ifcmaterialresource/lexical/ifcmaterialprofilesetusage.htm) : for parametric segments, this defines the cross section and alignment to the 'Axis' representation, from which the 'Body' representation may be generated.
* [IfcMaterialProfileSet](../../ifcmaterialresource/lexical/ifcmaterialprofilesetusage.htm) : for non-parametric segments (having fixed length or path), this may define the cross section for analysis purposes, however the 'Body' representation is independently generated.
* [IfcMaterialConstituentSet](../../ifcmaterialresource/lexical/ifcmaterialconstituentset.htm) : for elements containing multiple materials where profiles are not applicable, this indicates materials at named parts. 
*  [IfcMaterial](../../ifcmaterialresource/lexical/ifcmaterial.htm) : for elements comprised of a single material where profiles are not applicable, this indicates the material.

The material is attached by the _RelatingMaterial_ attribute on the [IfcRelAssociatesMaterial](../../ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcrelassociatesmaterial.htm) relationship. It is accessible by the _HasAssociations_ inverse attribute. Material information can also be given at the [IfcFlowSegmentType](../../ifcsharedbldgserviceelements/lexical/ifcflowsegmenttype.htm), defining the common attribute data for all occurrences of the same type. Standard names and material types are defined at subtypes.
