Approvals may be associated to indicate the status of acceptance or rejection using the _IfcRelAssociatesApproval_ relationship where _RelatingApproval_ refers to an _IfcApproval_ and _RelatedObjects_ contains the _IfcPermit_. Approvals may be split into sub-approvals using _IfcApprovalRelationship_ to track approval status separately for each party where _RelatingApproval_ refers to the higher-level approval and _RelatedApprovals_ contains one or more lower-level approvals. The hierarchy of approvals implies sequencing such that a higher-level approval is not executed until all of its lower-level approvals have been accepted.
